       "['Introduction In typical machine learning problems like image classification it is assumed that an image clearly represents a category (a class). However, in many real-life applications multiple instances are observed and only a general statement of the category is given. This scenario is called multiple instance learning (MIL) (Dietterich et al., 1997; Maron & Lozano-Pérez, 1998) or, learning from weakly annotated data (Oquab et al., 2014) . The problem of weakly annotated data is especially apparent in medical imaging (Quellec et al., 2017 ) (e.g., computational pathology, mammography or CT lung screening) where an image is typically described by a single label (benign/malignant) or a Region Of Interest (ROI) is roughly given. MIL deals with a bag of instances for which a single class label is assigned. Hence, the main goal of MIL is to learn a Proceedings of the 35 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Stockholm, Sweden, PMLR 80, 2018 . Copyright 2018 by the author(s). model that predicts a bag label, e.g., a medical diagnosis. An additional challenge is to discover key instances (Liu et al., 2012) , i.e., the instances that trigger the bag label. In the medical domain the latter task is of great interest because of legal issues 1 and its usefulness in clinical practice. In order to solve the primary task of a bag classification different methods are proposed, such as utilizing similarities among bags (Cheplygina et al., 2015b) , embedding instances to a compact low-dimensional representation that is further fed to a bag-level classifier (Andrews et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2006) , and combining responses of an instance-level classifier (Ramon & De Raedt, 2000; Raykar et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2006) . Only the last approach is capable of providing interpretable results. However, it was shown that the instance level accuracy of such methods is low (Kandemir & Hamprecht, 2015) and in general there is a disagreement among MIL methods at the instance level (Cheplygina et al., 2015a) . These issues call into question the usability of current MIL models for interpreting the final decision. In this paper, we propose a new method that aims at incorporating interpretability to the MIL approach and increasing its flexibility. We formulate the MIL model using the Bernoulli distribution for the bag label and train it by optimizing the log-likelihood function. We show that the application of the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions provides a general procedure for modeling the bag label probability (the bag score function) that consists of three steps: (i) a transformation of instances to a low-dimensional embedding, (ii) a permutation-invariant (symmetric) aggregation function, and (iii) a final transformation to the bag probability. We propose to parameterize all transformations using neural networks (i.e., a combination of convolutional and fully-connected layers), which increases the flexibility of the approach and allows to train the model in an endto-end manner by optimizing an unconstrained objective function. Last but not least, we propose to replace widelyused permutation-invariant operators such as the maximum operator max and the mean operator mean by a trainable weighted average where weights are given by a two-layered neural network. The two-layered neural network corre-sponds to the attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Raffel & Ellis, 2015) . Notably, the attention weights allow us to find key instances, which could be further used to highlight possible ROIs. In the experiments we show that our model is on a par with the best classical MIL methods on common benchmark MIL datasets, and that it outperforms other methods on a MNIST-based MIL problem as well as two real-life histopathology image datasets. Moreover, in the image datasets we provide empirical evidence that our model can indicate key instances.',\n",

       " 'Multiple instance learning (MIL) Problem formulation In the classical (binary) supervised learning problem one aims at finding a model that predicts a value of a target variable, y ∈ {0, 1}, for a given instance, x ∈ R D . In the case of the MIL problem, however, instead of a single instance there is a bag of instances, X = {x 1 , . . . , x K }, that exhibit neither dependency nor ordering among each other. We assume that K could vary for different bags. There is also a single binary label Y associated with the bag. Furthermore, we assume that individual labels exist for the instances within a bag, i.e., y 1 , . . . , y K and y k ∈ {0, 1}, for k = 1, . . . , K, however, there is no access to those labels and they remain unknown during training. We can re-write the assumptions of the MIL problem in the following form: Y = 0, iff k y k = 0, 1, otherwise. (1) These assumptions imply that a MIL model must be permutation-invariant. Further, the two statements could be re-formulated in a compact form using the maximum operator: Y = max k {y k }. (2) Learning a model that tries to optimize an objective based on the maximum over instance labels would be problematic at least for two reasons. First, all gradient-based learning methods would encounter issues with vanishing gradients. Second, this formulation is suitable only when an instancelevel classifier is used. In order to make the learning problem easier, we propose to train a MIL model by optimizing the log-likelihood function where the bag label is distributed according to the Bernoulli distribution with the parameter θ(X) ∈ [0, 1], i.e., the probability of Y = 1 given the bag of instances X. MIL approaches In the MIL setting the bag probability θ(X) must be permutation-invariant since we assume neither ordering nor dependency of instances within a bag. Therefore, the MIL problem can be considered in terms of a specific form of the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions with monomials given by the following theorem (Zaheer et al., 2017) : Theorem 1. A scoring function for a set of instances X, S(X) ∈ R, is a symmetric function (i.e., permutationinvariant to the elements in X), if and only if it can be decomposed in the following form: S(X) = g x∈X f (x) , (3) where f and g are suitable transformations. This theorem provides a general strategy for modeling the bag probability using the decomposition given in (3) . A similar decomposition with max instead of sum is given by the following theorem : Theorem 2. For any ε > 0, a Hausdorff continuous symmetric function S(X) ∈ R can be arbitrarily approximated by a function in the form g max x∈X f (x) , where max is the element-wise vector maximum operator and f and g are continuous functions, that is: |S(X) − g max x∈X f (x) | < ε. (4) The difference between Theorems 1 and 2 is that the former is a universal decomposition while the latter provides an arbitrary approximation. Nonetheless, they both formulate a general three-step approach for classifying a bag of instances: (i) a transformation of instances using the function f , (ii) a combination of transformed instances using a symmetric (permutation-invariant) function σ, (iii) a transformation of combined instances transformed by f using a function g. Finally, the expressiveness of the score function relies on the choice of classes of functions for f and g. In the MIL problem formulation the score function in both theorems is the probability θ(X) and the permutationinvariant function σ is referred to as the MIL pooling. The choice of functions f , g and σ determines a specific approach to modeling the label probability. For a given MIL operator there are two main MIL approaches: (i) The instance-level approach: The transformation f is an instance-level classifier that returns scores for each instance. Then individual scores are aggregated by MIL pooling to obtain θ(X). The function g is the identity function. (ii) The embedding-level approach: The function f maps instances to a low-dimensional embedding. MIL pooling is used to obtain a bag representation that is independent of the number of instances in the bag. The bag representation is further processed by a bag-level classifier to provide θ(X). It is advocated in (Wang et al., 2016) that the latter approach is preferable in terms of the bag level classification performance. Since the individual labels are unknown, there is a threat that the instance-level classifier might be trained insufficiently and it introduces additional error to the final prediction. The embedding-level approach determines a joint representation of a bag and therefore it does not introduce additional bias to the bag-level classifier. On the other hand, the instance-level approach provides a score that can be used to find key instances i.e., the instances that trigger the bag label. Liu et al. (2012) were able to show that a model that is successfully detecting key instances is more likely to achieve better bag label predictions. We will show how to modify the embedding-level approach to be interpretable by using a new MIL pooling.',\n",
       " 'MIL with Neural Networks In classical MIL problems it is assumed that instances are represented by features that do not require further processing, i.e., f is the identity. However, for some tasks like image or text analysis additional steps of feature extraction are necessary. Additionally, Theorem 1 and 2 indicate that for a flexible enough class of functions we can model any permutation-invariant score function. Therefore, we consider a class of transformations that are parameterized by neural networks f ψ (·) with parameters ψ that transform the k-th instance into a low-dimensional embedding, h k = f ψ (x k ), where h k ∈ H such that H = [0, 1] for the instance-based approach and H = R M for the embeddingbased approach. Eventually, the parameter θ(X) is determined by a transformation g φ : H K → [0, 1]. In the instance-based approach the transformation g φ is simply the identity, while in the embedding-based approach it could be also parameterized by a neural network with parameters φ. The former approach is depicted in Figure 6 (a) and the latter in Figure  6 (b) in the Appendix. The idea of parameterizing all transformations using neural networks is very appealing because the whole approach can be arbitrarily flexible and it can be trained end-to-end by backpropagation. The only restriction is that the MIL pooling must be differentiable.',\n",
       " 'MIL pooling The formulation of the MIL problem requires the MIL pooling σ to be permutation-invariant. As shown in Theorem 1 and 2, there are two MIL pooling operators that ensure the score function (i.e., the bag probability) to be a symmetric function, namely, the maximum operator: ∀ m=1,...,M : z m = max k=1,...,K {h km }, (5) and the mean operator: 2 z = 1 K K k=1 h k . (6) In fact, other operators could be used such as, the convex maximum operator (i.e., log-sum-exp) (Ramon & De Raedt, 2000) , Integrated Segmentation and Recognition (Keeler et al., 1991) , noisy-or (Maron & Lozano-Pérez, 1998 ) and noisy-and (Kraus et al., 2016) . These MIL pooling operators could replace max in Theorem 2 and proofs would follow in a similar manner (see Supplementary in  for a detailed proof for the maximum operator). All of these operators are differentiable, hence, they could be easily used as a MIL pooling layer in a deep neural network architecture.',\n",
       " 'Attention-based MIL pooling All MIL pooling operators mentioned in the previous section have a clear disadvantage, namely, they are pre-defined and non-trainable. For instance, the max-operator could be a good choice in the instance-based approach but it might be inappropriate for the embedding-based approach. Similarly, the mean operator is definitely a bad MIL pooling to aggregate instance scores, although, it could succeed in calculating the bag representation. Therefore, a flexible and adaptive MIL pooling could potentially achieve better results by adjusting to a task and data. Ideally, such MIL pooling should also be interpretable, a trait that is missing in all operators mentioned in Section 2.3.',\n",
       " 'Attention mechanism We propose to use a weighted average of instances (low-dimensional embeddings) where weights are determined by a neural network. Additionally, the weights must sum to 1 to be invariant to the size of a bag. The weighted average fulfills the requirements of the Theorem 1 where the weights together with the embeddings are part of the f function. Let H = {h 1 , . . . , h K } be a bag of K embeddings, then we propose the following MIL pooling: z = K k=1 a k h k , (7) where: a k = exp{w tanh Vh k } K j=1 exp{w tanh Vh j } , (8) where w ∈ R L×1 and V ∈ R L×M are parameters. Moreover, we utilize the hyperbolic tangent tanh(·) element-wise non-linearity to include both negative and positive values for proper gradient flow. The proposed construction allows to discover (dis)similarities among instances. Interestingly, the proposed MIL pooling corresponds to a version of the attention mechanism (Lin et al., 2017; Raffel & Ellis, 2015) . The main difference is that typically in the attention mechanism all instances are sequentially dependent while here we assume that all instances are independent. Therefore, a naturally arising question is whether the attention mechanism could work without sequential dependencies among instances, and if it will not learn the mean operator. We will address this issue in the experiments. Gated attention mechanism Furthermore, we notice that the tanh(·) non-linearity could be inefficient to learn complex relations. Our concern follows from the fact that tanh(x) is approximately linear for x ∈ [−1, 1], which could limit the final expressiveness of learned relations among instances. Therefore, we propose to additionally use the gating mechanism (Dauphin et al., 2016) together with tanh(·) non-linearity that yields: a k = exp{w tanh Vh k sigm Uh k } K j=1 exp{w tanh Vh j ) sigm Uh j } , (9) where U ∈ R L×M are parameters, is an element-wise multiplication and sigm(·) is the sigmoid non-linearity. The gating mechanism introduces a learnable non-linearity that potentially removes the troublesome linearity in tanh(·). Flexibility In principle, the proposed attention-based MIL pooling allows to assign different weights to instances within a bag and hence the final representation of the bag could be highly informative for the bag-level classifier. In other words, it should be able to find key instances. Moreover, application of the attention-based MIL pooling together with the transformations f and g parameterized by neural networks makes the whole model fully differentiable and adaptive. These two facts make the proposed MIL pooling a potentially very flexible operator that could model an arbitrary permutation-invariant score function. The proposed attention mechanism together with a deep MIL model is depicted in Figure 6 (c) in the Appendix. Interpretability Ideally, in the case of a positive label (Y = 1), high attention weights should be assigned to instances that are likely to have label y k = 1 (key instances). Namely, the attention mechanism allows to easily interpret the provided decision in terms of instance-level labels. In fact, the attention network does not provide scores as the instance-based classifier does but it can be considered as a proxy to that. The attention-based MIL pooling bridges the instance-level approach and the embedding-level approach. From the practical point of view, e.g., in the computational pathology, it is desirable to provide ROIs together with the final diagnosis to a doctor. Therefore, the attention mechanism is potentially of great interest in practical applications.',\n",
       " 'Related work MIL pooling Typically, MIL approaches utilize either the mean pooling or the max pooling, while the latter is mostly used Pinheiro & Collobert, 2015; Zhu et al., 2017) . Both operators are non-trainable which potentially limits their applicability. There are MIL pooling operators that contain global adaptive parameters, such as noisy-and (Kraus et al., 2016) , however, their flexibility is restricted. We propose a fully trainable MIL pooling that adapts to new instances. MIL with neural networks In the classical work on MIL it is assumed that instances are represented by precomputed features and there is very little need to apply additional feature extraction. Nevertheless, recent work on utilizing fully-connected neural networks in MIL shows that it could still be beneficial (Wang et al., 2016) . Similarly, in computer vision the idea of MIL combined with deep learning significantly improves final accuracy (Oquab et al., 2014) . In this paper, we follow this line of research since it allows to apply a flexible class of transformations that can be trained end-to-end by backpropagation.',\n",
       " 'MIL and attention The attention mechanism is widely used in deep learning for image captioning (Xu et al., 2015) or text analysis (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2017) . In the context of the MIL problem it has rarely been used and only in a very limited form. In (Pappas & Popescu-Belis, 2014 ) an attention-based MIL was proposed but attention weights were trained as parameters of an auxiliary linear regression model. This idea was further expanded and the linear regression model was replaced by a one-layer neural network with single output (Pappas & Popescu-Belis, 2017) . The attention-based MIL operator was used very recently in , however, the attention was calculated using the dot product and it performed worse than the max operator. Here, we propose to use a two-layered neural network to learn the MIL operator and we show that it outperforms commonly used MIL pooling operators. MIL for medical imaging The MIL seems to perfectly fit medical imaging where processing a whole image consisting of billions of pixels is computationally infeasible. Moreover, in the medical domain it is very difficult to obtain pixel-level annotations, that drastically reduces number of available data. Therefore, it is tempting to divide a medical image into smaller patches that could be further considered as a bag with a single label (Quellec et al., 2017) . This idea attracts a great interest in the computational histopathology where patches could correspond to cells that are believed to indicate malignant changes (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) . Different MIL approaches were used for histopathology data, such as, Gaussian processes (Kandemir et al., 2014; or a two-stage approach with neural networks and EM algorithm to determine instance classes (Hou et al., 2016) . Other applications of MIL methods in medical imaging are mammography (nodule) classification (Zhu et al., 2017) and microscopy cell detection (Kraus et al., 2016) . In this paper, we show that the proposed attention-based deep MIL approach can be used not only to provide the final diagnosis but also to indicate ROIs in a histopathology slide.',\n",
       " \"Experiments In the experiments we aim at evaluating the proposed approach: a MIL model parameterized with neural networks and a (gated) attention-based pooling layer ('Attention' and 'Gated-Attention'). We evaluate our approach on a number of different MIL datasets: five MIL benchmark datasets (MUSK1, MUSK2, FOX, TIGER, ELEPHANT), an MNIST-based image dataset (MNIST-BAGS) and two reallife histopathology datasets (BREAST CANCER, COLON CANCER). We want to verify two research questions in the experiments: (i) whether our approach achieves the best performance or is comparable to the best performing method, (ii) if our method can provide interpretable results by using the attention weights that indicate key instances or ROIs. In order to obtain a fair comparison we use a common evaluation methodology, i.e., 10-fold-cross-validation, and five repetitions per experiment. In the case of MNIST-BAGS we use a fixed division into training and test set. In order to create test bags we solely sampled images from the MNIST test set. During training we only used images from the MNIST training set. For all experiments we use modified versions of models that have shown high classification performance on the individual datasets (Wang et al., 2016; LeCun et al., 1998; Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) . The MIL pooling layers are either located before the last layer of the model (the embedded-based approach) or after last layer of the model (the instance-based approach). If an attention-based MIL pooling layer is used the number of parameters in V was determined using a validation set. We tested the following dimensions (L): 64, 128 and 256. The different dimensions only resulted in minor changes of the model's performance. For layers using the gated attention mechanism V and U have the same number of parameters. Finally, all layers were initialized according to Glorot & Bengio (2010) and biases were set to zero. We compare our approach to various MIL methods on MIL benchmark datasets. On the image datasets our method is compared with instance-level and embedding-level neural networks and commonly used MIL pooling layers (max and mean). In the following, we are using 'Instance+max/mean' and 'Embedding+max/mean' to indicate networks that are build from convolutional layers and fully-connected layers. In contrast to networks purely build from fully-connected layers, referred to as 'mi-Net' and 'MI-Net' (Wang et al., 2016) . On MNIST-BAGS we include a SVM-based MIL model, called (MI-SVM). We do not present results of MI-SVM on the histopathology datasets since we could not train (including hyperparameter search and five times 10-fold-crossvalidation procedure) the model in a reasonable amount of time. 3 In order to compare the bag level performance we use the following metrics: the classification accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\",\n",
       " 'Classical MIL datasets Details In the first experiment we aim at verifying whether our approach can compete with the best MIL methods on historically important benchmark datasets. Since all five datasets contain precomputed features and only a small number of instances and bags, neural networks are most likely not well suited. First we predict drug activity (MUSK1 and MUSK2). A molecule has the desired drug effect if and only if one or more of its conformations bind to the target binding site. Since molecules can adopt multiple shapes, a bag is made up of shapes belonging to the same molecule (Dietterich et al., 1997) . The three remaining datasets, ELE-PHANT, FOX and TIGER, contain features extracted from images. Each bag consists of a set of segments of an image. For each category, positive bags are images that contain the animal of interest, and negative bags are images that contain other animals (Andrews et al., 2003) . For detailed information on the number of bags, instances and features in each dataset see Section 6.3 in the Appendix. In our experiments we use the same architecture, optimizer and hyperparameters as in the MI-Net model (Wang et al., 2016) . presented in Table 1 . Our approaches (Attention and Gated-Attention) are comparable with the best performing classical MIL methods (notice the standard error of the mean).',\n",
       " \"MNIST-bags Details The main disadvantage of the classical MIL benchmark datasets is that instances are represented by precomputed features. In order to consider a more challenging scenario, we propose to investigate a dataset that is created using the well-known MNIST image dataset. A bag is made up of a random number of 28 × 28 grayscale images taken from the MNIST dataset. The number of images in a bag is Gaussian-distributed and the closest integer value is taken. A bag is given a positive label if it contains one or more images with the label '9'. We chose '9' since it can be easily mistaken with '7' or '4'. We investigate the influence of the number of bags in the training set as well as the average number of instances per bag on the prediction performance. During evaluation we use a fixed number of 1000 test bags. For all experiments a LeNet5 model is used (LeCun et al., 1998) , see Table 8 and 9 in the Appendix. The models are trained with the Adam optimization algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014) . We keep the default parameters for β 1 and β 2 , see Table 10 in the Appendix. In addition, we compare our method with a SVM-based MIL method (MI-SVM) (Andrews et al., 2003) that uses a Gaussian kernel on raw pixel features 4 . In the experiments we use different numbers of the mean bag size, namely, 10, 50 and 100, and the variance 2, 10, 20, respectively. Moreover, we use varying numbers of training bags, i.e., 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500. These different settings allow us to verify how different number of training bags and different number of instances influence MIL models. We compare instance-based and embedding-based approaches parameterized with a neural network (LeNet5) with mean and max MIL pooling. We use AUC as the evaluation metric.\",\n",
       " 'Results and discussion The results of AUC for the mean bag sizes equal to 10, 50 and 100 are presented in Figure 1 , 2 and 3, respectively, and detailed results are given in the Appendix. The findings of the experiment are the following: First, the proposed attention-based deep MIL approach performs much better than other methods in the small sample size regime. Moreover, when there is a small effective size of the training set that corresponds to 50-150 bags for around 10 instances per bag (see Figure 1 ) or 50-100 bags in the case of on average 50 instances in a bag (see Figure  2 ), our method still achieves significantly higher AUC than all other methods. Second, we notice that our approach is more flexible and obtained better results than the SVM-   based approach in all cases except large effective sample sizes (see Figure 3) . Third, the embedding-based models performed better than the instance-based models. However, for a sufficient number of training images (number of training bags and training instances per bag) all models achieve very similar results. Fourth, the mean operator performs significantly worse than the max operator. However, the embedding-based model with the mean operator converged eventually to the best value but always later than the one with max. See Section 6.4 in the Appendix for details. The results of this experiment indicate that for a smallsample size regime our approach is preferable to others. Since attention serves as a gradient update filter during backpropagation (Wang et al., 2017) , instances with higher weights will contribute more to learning the encoder network of instances. This is especially important since medical imaging problems contain only a small number of cases. In general, the more instances are in a bag the easier the MIL task becomes, since the MIL assumption states that every instance in a negative bag is negative. For example, a negative bag of size 100 from the MNIST-bags dataset will include about 11 negative examples per class. Finally, we present an exemplary result of the attention mechanism in Figure 4 . In this example a bag consists of 13 images. For each digit the corresponding attention weight is given by the trained network. The bag is properly predicted as positive and all nines are correctly highlighted. Hence, the attention mechanism works as expected. More examples are given in the Appendix.',\n",
       " 'Histopathology datasets Details An automatic detection of cancerous regions in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images is a task with high clinical relevance. Current supervised approaches utilize pixel-level annotations (Litjens et al., 2017) . However, data preparation requires large amount of time from pathologists which highly interferes with their daily routines. Hence, a successful solution working with weak labels would hold a great promise to reduce the workload of the pathologists. In the following, we perform two experiments on classifying weakly-labeled real-life histopathol-ogy images of the breast cancer dataset (BREAST CANCER) (Gelasca et al., 2008) and the colon cancer dataset (COLON CANCER) (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) . BREAST CANCER consists of 58 weakly labeled 896 × 768 H&E images. An image is labeled malignant if it contains breast cancer cells, otherwise it is benign. We divide every image into 32 × 32 patches. This results in 672 patches per bag. A patch is discarded if it contains 75% or more of white pixels. COLON CANCER comprises 100 H&E images. The images originate from a variety of tissue appearance from both normal and malignant regions. For every image the majority of nuclei of each cell were marked. In total there are 22,444 nuclei with associated class label, i.e. epithelial, inflammatory, fibroblast, and miscellaneous. A bag is composed of 27 × 27 patches. Furthermore, a bag is given a positive label if it contains one or more nuclei from the epithelial class. Tagging epithelial cells is highly relevant from a clinical point of view, since colon cancer originates from epithelial cells (Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2007) . For both datasets we use the model proposed in (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) for the transformation f . All models are trained with the Adam optimization algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014) . Due to the limited amount of data samples in both datasets we performed data augmentation to prevent overfitting. See the Appendix for further details. Results and discussion We present results in Table 2 and 3 for BREAST CANCER and COLON CANCER, respectively. First, we notice that the obtained results confirm our findings in MNIST-BAGS experiment that our approach outperforms all other methods. A trend that is especially visible in the small-sample size regime of the MNIST-BAGS. Surprisingly, the embedding-based method with the max pooling failed almost completely on BREAST CANCER but in general this dataset is difficult due to high variability of slides and small number of cases. The proposed method is not only most accurate but it also received the highest recall. High recall is especially important in the medical domain since false negatives could lead to severe consequences including patient fatality. We also notice that the gated-attention mechanism performs better than the plain attention mechanism on BREAST CANCER while these two behave similarly on COLON CANCER. Eventually, we present the usefulness of the attention mechanism in providing ROIs. In Figure 5 we show a histopathology image divided into patches containing (mostly) single cells. We create a heatmap by multiplying patches by its corresponding attention weight. Although only image-level annotations are used during training, there is a substantial matching between the heatmap in Figure 5 (d) and the ground truth in Figure 5(c) . Additionally, we notice that Table 2 . Results on BREAST CANCER. Experiments were run 5 times and an average (± a standard error of the mean) is reported. the instance-based classifier tends to select only a small subset of positive patches (see Figure 10 (e) in Appendix) that confirms low instance accuracy of the instance-based approach discussed in (Kandemir & Hamprecht, 2015) . For more examples please see the Appendix.',\n",

       "['Introduction In typical machine learning problems like image classification it is assumed that an image clearly represents a category (a class). However, in many real-life applications multiple instances are observed and only a general statement of the category is given. This scenario is called multiple instance learning (MIL) (Dietterich et al., 1997; Maron & Lozano-Pérez, 1998) or, learning from weakly annotated data (Oquab et al., 2014) . The problem of weakly annotated data is especially apparent in medical imaging (Quellec et al., 2017 ) (e.g., computational pathology, mammography or CT lung screening) where an image is typically described by a single label (benign/malignant) or a Region Of Interest (ROI) is roughly given. MIL deals with a bag of instances for which a single class label is assigned. Hence, the main goal of MIL is to learn a Proceedings of the 35 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Stockholm, Sweden, PMLR 80, 2018 . Copyright 2018 by the author(s). model that predicts a bag label, e.g., a medical diagnosis. An additional challenge is to discover key instances (Liu et al., 2012) , i.e., the instances that trigger the bag label. In the medical domain the latter task is of great interest because of legal issues 1 and its usefulness in clinical practice. In order to solve the primary task of a bag classification different methods are proposed, such as utilizing similarities among bags (Cheplygina et al., 2015b) , embedding instances to a compact low-dimensional representation that is further fed to a bag-level classifier (Andrews et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2006) , and combining responses of an instance-level classifier (Ramon & De Raedt, 2000; Raykar et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2006) . Only the last approach is capable of providing interpretable results. However, it was shown that the instance level accuracy of such methods is low (Kandemir & Hamprecht, 2015) and in general there is a disagreement among MIL methods at the instance level (Cheplygina et al., 2015a) . These issues call into question the usability of current MIL models for interpreting the final decision. In this paper, we propose a new method that aims at incorporating interpretability to the MIL approach and increasing its flexibility. We formulate the MIL model using the Bernoulli distribution for the bag label and train it by optimizing the log-likelihood function. We show that the application of the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions provides a general procedure for modeling the bag label probability (the bag score function) that consists of three steps: (i) a transformation of instances to a low-dimensional embedding, (ii) a permutation-invariant (symmetric) aggregation function, and (iii) a final transformation to the bag probability. We propose to parameterize all transformations using neural networks (i.e., a combination of convolutional and fully-connected layers), which increases the flexibility of the approach and allows to train the model in an endto-end manner by optimizing an unconstrained objective function. Last but not least, we propose to replace widelyused permutation-invariant operators such as the maximum operator max and the mean operator mean by a trainable weighted average where weights are given by a two-layered neural network. The two-layered neural network corre-sponds to the attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Raffel & Ellis, 2015) . Notably, the attention weights allow us to find key instances, which could be further used to highlight possible ROIs. In the experiments we show that our model is on a par with the best classical MIL methods on common benchmark MIL datasets, and that it outperforms other methods on a MNIST-based MIL problem as well as two real-life histopathology image datasets. Moreover, in the image datasets we provide empirical evidence that our model can indicate key instances.',\n",

       " 'Multiple instance learning (MIL) Problem formulation In the classical (binary) supervised learning problem one aims at finding a model that predicts a value of a target variable, y ∈ {0, 1}, for a given instance, x ∈ R D . In the case of the MIL problem, however, instead of a single instance there is a bag of instances, X = {x 1 , . . . , x K }, that exhibit neither dependency nor ordering among each other. We assume that K could vary for different bags. There is also a single binary label Y associated with the bag. Furthermore, we assume that individual labels exist for the instances within a bag, i.e., y 1 , . . . , y K and y k ∈ {0, 1}, for k = 1, . . . , K, however, there is no access to those labels and they remain unknown during training. We can re-write the assumptions of the MIL problem in the following form: Y = 0, iff k y k = 0, 1, otherwise. (1) These assumptions imply that a MIL model must be permutation-invariant. Further, the two statements could be re-formulated in a compact form using the maximum operator: Y = max k {y k }. (2) Learning a model that tries to optimize an objective based on the maximum over instance labels would be problematic at least for two reasons. First, all gradient-based learning methods would encounter issues with vanishing gradients. Second, this formulation is suitable only when an instancelevel classifier is used. In order to make the learning problem easier, we propose to train a MIL model by optimizing the log-likelihood function where the bag label is distributed according to the Bernoulli distribution with the parameter θ(X) ∈ [0, 1], i.e., the probability of Y = 1 given the bag of instances X. MIL approaches In the MIL setting the bag probability θ(X) must be permutation-invariant since we assume neither ordering nor dependency of instances within a bag. Therefore, the MIL problem can be considered in terms of a specific form of the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions with monomials given by the following theorem (Zaheer et al., 2017) : Theorem 1. A scoring function for a set of instances X, S(X) ∈ R, is a symmetric function (i.e., permutationinvariant to the elements in X), if and only if it can be decomposed in the following form: S(X) = g x∈X f (x) , (3) where f and g are suitable transformations. This theorem provides a general strategy for modeling the bag probability using the decomposition given in (3) . A similar decomposition with max instead of sum is given by the following theorem : Theorem 2. For any ε > 0, a Hausdorff continuous symmetric function S(X) ∈ R can be arbitrarily approximated by a function in the form g max x∈X f (x) , where max is the element-wise vector maximum operator and f and g are continuous functions, that is: |S(X) − g max x∈X f (x) | < ε. (4) The difference between Theorems 1 and 2 is that the former is a universal decomposition while the latter provides an arbitrary approximation. Nonetheless, they both formulate a general three-step approach for classifying a bag of instances: (i) a transformation of instances using the function f , (ii) a combination of transformed instances using a symmetric (permutation-invariant) function σ, (iii) a transformation of combined instances transformed by f using a function g. Finally, the expressiveness of the score function relies on the choice of classes of functions for f and g. In the MIL problem formulation the score function in both theorems is the probability θ(X) and the permutationinvariant function σ is referred to as the MIL pooling. The choice of functions f , g and σ determines a specific approach to modeling the label probability. For a given MIL operator there are two main MIL approaches: (i) The instance-level approach: The transformation f is an instance-level classifier that returns scores for each instance. Then individual scores are aggregated by MIL pooling to obtain θ(X). The function g is the identity function. (ii) The embedding-level approach: The function f maps instances to a low-dimensional embedding. MIL pooling is used to obtain a bag representation that is independent of the number of instances in the bag. The bag representation is further processed by a bag-level classifier to provide θ(X). It is advocated in (Wang et al., 2016) that the latter approach is preferable in terms of the bag level classification performance. Since the individual labels are unknown, there is a threat that the instance-level classifier might be trained insufficiently and it introduces additional error to the final prediction. The embedding-level approach determines a joint representation of a bag and therefore it does not introduce additional bias to the bag-level classifier. On the other hand, the instance-level approach provides a score that can be used to find key instances i.e., the instances that trigger the bag label. Liu et al. (2012) were able to show that a model that is successfully detecting key instances is more likely to achieve better bag label predictions. We will show how to modify the embedding-level approach to be interpretable by using a new MIL pooling.',\n",
       " 'MIL with Neural Networks In classical MIL problems it is assumed that instances are represented by features that do not require further processing, i.e., f is the identity. However, for some tasks like image or text analysis additional steps of feature extraction are necessary. Additionally, Theorem 1 and 2 indicate that for a flexible enough class of functions we can model any permutation-invariant score function. Therefore, we consider a class of transformations that are parameterized by neural networks f ψ (·) with parameters ψ that transform the k-th instance into a low-dimensional embedding, h k = f ψ (x k ), where h k ∈ H such that H = [0, 1] for the instance-based approach and H = R M for the embeddingbased approach. Eventually, the parameter θ(X) is determined by a transformation g φ : H K → [0, 1]. In the instance-based approach the transformation g φ is simply the identity, while in the embedding-based approach it could be also parameterized by a neural network with parameters φ. The former approach is depicted in Figure 6 (a) and the latter in Figure  6 (b) in the Appendix. The idea of parameterizing all transformations using neural networks is very appealing because the whole approach can be arbitrarily flexible and it can be trained end-to-end by backpropagation. The only restriction is that the MIL pooling must be differentiable.',\n",
       " 'MIL pooling The formulation of the MIL problem requires the MIL pooling σ to be permutation-invariant. As shown in Theorem 1 and 2, there are two MIL pooling operators that ensure the score function (i.e., the bag probability) to be a symmetric function, namely, the maximum operator: ∀ m=1,...,M : z m = max k=1,...,K {h km }, (5) and the mean operator: 2 z = 1 K K k=1 h k . (6) In fact, other operators could be used such as, the convex maximum operator (i.e., log-sum-exp) (Ramon & De Raedt, 2000) , Integrated Segmentation and Recognition (Keeler et al., 1991) , noisy-or (Maron & Lozano-Pérez, 1998 ) and noisy-and (Kraus et al., 2016) . These MIL pooling operators could replace max in Theorem 2 and proofs would follow in a similar manner (see Supplementary in  for a detailed proof for the maximum operator). All of these operators are differentiable, hence, they could be easily used as a MIL pooling layer in a deep neural network architecture.',\n",
       " 'Attention-based MIL pooling All MIL pooling operators mentioned in the previous section have a clear disadvantage, namely, they are pre-defined and non-trainable. For instance, the max-operator could be a good choice in the instance-based approach but it might be inappropriate for the embedding-based approach. Similarly, the mean operator is definitely a bad MIL pooling to aggregate instance scores, although, it could succeed in calculating the bag representation. Therefore, a flexible and adaptive MIL pooling could potentially achieve better results by adjusting to a task and data. Ideally, such MIL pooling should also be interpretable, a trait that is missing in all operators mentioned in Section 2.3.',\n",
       " 'Attention mechanism We propose to use a weighted average of instances (low-dimensional embeddings) where weights are determined by a neural network. Additionally, the weights must sum to 1 to be invariant to the size of a bag. The weighted average fulfills the requirements of the Theorem 1 where the weights together with the embeddings are part of the f function. Let H = {h 1 , . . . , h K } be a bag of K embeddings, then we propose the following MIL pooling: z = K k=1 a k h k , (7) where: a k = exp{w tanh Vh k } K j=1 exp{w tanh Vh j } , (8) where w ∈ R L×1 and V ∈ R L×M are parameters. Moreover, we utilize the hyperbolic tangent tanh(·) element-wise non-linearity to include both negative and positive values for proper gradient flow. The proposed construction allows to discover (dis)similarities among instances. Interestingly, the proposed MIL pooling corresponds to a version of the attention mechanism (Lin et al., 2017; Raffel & Ellis, 2015) . The main difference is that typically in the attention mechanism all instances are sequentially dependent while here we assume that all instances are independent. Therefore, a naturally arising question is whether the attention mechanism could work without sequential dependencies among instances, and if it will not learn the mean operator. We will address this issue in the experiments. Gated attention mechanism Furthermore, we notice that the tanh(·) non-linearity could be inefficient to learn complex relations. Our concern follows from the fact that tanh(x) is approximately linear for x ∈ [−1, 1], which could limit the final expressiveness of learned relations among instances. Therefore, we propose to additionally use the gating mechanism (Dauphin et al., 2016) together with tanh(·) non-linearity that yields: a k = exp{w tanh Vh k sigm Uh k } K j=1 exp{w tanh Vh j ) sigm Uh j } , (9) where U ∈ R L×M are parameters, is an element-wise multiplication and sigm(·) is the sigmoid non-linearity. The gating mechanism introduces a learnable non-linearity that potentially removes the troublesome linearity in tanh(·). Flexibility In principle, the proposed attention-based MIL pooling allows to assign different weights to instances within a bag and hence the final representation of the bag could be highly informative for the bag-level classifier. In other words, it should be able to find key instances. Moreover, application of the attention-based MIL pooling together with the transformations f and g parameterized by neural networks makes the whole model fully differentiable and adaptive. These two facts make the proposed MIL pooling a potentially very flexible operator that could model an arbitrary permutation-invariant score function. The proposed attention mechanism together with a deep MIL model is depicted in Figure 6 (c) in the Appendix. Interpretability Ideally, in the case of a positive label (Y = 1), high attention weights should be assigned to instances that are likely to have label y k = 1 (key instances). Namely, the attention mechanism allows to easily interpret the provided decision in terms of instance-level labels. In fact, the attention network does not provide scores as the instance-based classifier does but it can be considered as a proxy to that. The attention-based MIL pooling bridges the instance-level approach and the embedding-level approach. From the practical point of view, e.g., in the computational pathology, it is desirable to provide ROIs together with the final diagnosis to a doctor. Therefore, the attention mechanism is potentially of great interest in practical applications.',\n",
       " 'Related work MIL pooling Typically, MIL approaches utilize either the mean pooling or the max pooling, while the latter is mostly used Pinheiro & Collobert, 2015; Zhu et al., 2017) . Both operators are non-trainable which potentially limits their applicability. There are MIL pooling operators that contain global adaptive parameters, such as noisy-and (Kraus et al., 2016) , however, their flexibility is restricted. We propose a fully trainable MIL pooling that adapts to new instances. MIL with neural networks In the classical work on MIL it is assumed that instances are represented by precomputed features and there is very little need to apply additional feature extraction. Nevertheless, recent work on utilizing fully-connected neural networks in MIL shows that it could still be beneficial (Wang et al., 2016) . Similarly, in computer vision the idea of MIL combined with deep learning significantly improves final accuracy (Oquab et al., 2014) . In this paper, we follow this line of research since it allows to apply a flexible class of transformations that can be trained end-to-end by backpropagation.',\n",
       " 'MIL and attention The attention mechanism is widely used in deep learning for image captioning (Xu et al., 2015) or text analysis (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2017) . In the context of the MIL problem it has rarely been used and only in a very limited form. In (Pappas & Popescu-Belis, 2014 ) an attention-based MIL was proposed but attention weights were trained as parameters of an auxiliary linear regression model. This idea was further expanded and the linear regression model was replaced by a one-layer neural network with single output (Pappas & Popescu-Belis, 2017) . The attention-based MIL operator was used very recently in , however, the attention was calculated using the dot product and it performed worse than the max operator. Here, we propose to use a two-layered neural network to learn the MIL operator and we show that it outperforms commonly used MIL pooling operators. MIL for medical imaging The MIL seems to perfectly fit medical imaging where processing a whole image consisting of billions of pixels is computationally infeasible. Moreover, in the medical domain it is very difficult to obtain pixel-level annotations, that drastically reduces number of available data. Therefore, it is tempting to divide a medical image into smaller patches that could be further considered as a bag with a single label (Quellec et al., 2017) . This idea attracts a great interest in the computational histopathology where patches could correspond to cells that are believed to indicate malignant changes (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) . Different MIL approaches were used for histopathology data, such as, Gaussian processes (Kandemir et al., 2014; or a two-stage approach with neural networks and EM algorithm to determine instance classes (Hou et al., 2016) . Other applications of MIL methods in medical imaging are mammography (nodule) classification (Zhu et al., 2017) and microscopy cell detection (Kraus et al., 2016) . In this paper, we show that the proposed attention-based deep MIL approach can be used not only to provide the final diagnosis but also to indicate ROIs in a histopathology slide.',\n",
       " \"Experiments In the experiments we aim at evaluating the proposed approach: a MIL model parameterized with neural networks and a (gated) attention-based pooling layer ('Attention' and 'Gated-Attention'). We evaluate our approach on a number of different MIL datasets: five MIL benchmark datasets (MUSK1, MUSK2, FOX, TIGER, ELEPHANT), an MNIST-based image dataset (MNIST-BAGS) and two reallife histopathology datasets (BREAST CANCER, COLON CANCER). We want to verify two research questions in the experiments: (i) whether our approach achieves the best performance or is comparable to the best performing method, (ii) if our method can provide interpretable results by using the attention weights that indicate key instances or ROIs. In order to obtain a fair comparison we use a common evaluation methodology, i.e., 10-fold-cross-validation, and five repetitions per experiment. In the case of MNIST-BAGS we use a fixed division into training and test set. In order to create test bags we solely sampled images from the MNIST test set. During training we only used images from the MNIST training set. For all experiments we use modified versions of models that have shown high classification performance on the individual datasets (Wang et al., 2016; LeCun et al., 1998; Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) . The MIL pooling layers are either located before the last layer of the model (the embedded-based approach) or after last layer of the model (the instance-based approach). If an attention-based MIL pooling layer is used the number of parameters in V was determined using a validation set. We tested the following dimensions (L): 64, 128 and 256. The different dimensions only resulted in minor changes of the model's performance. For layers using the gated attention mechanism V and U have the same number of parameters. Finally, all layers were initialized according to Glorot & Bengio (2010) and biases were set to zero. We compare our approach to various MIL methods on MIL benchmark datasets. On the image datasets our method is compared with instance-level and embedding-level neural networks and commonly used MIL pooling layers (max and mean). In the following, we are using 'Instance+max/mean' and 'Embedding+max/mean' to indicate networks that are build from convolutional layers and fully-connected layers. In contrast to networks purely build from fully-connected layers, referred to as 'mi-Net' and 'MI-Net' (Wang et al., 2016) . On MNIST-BAGS we include a SVM-based MIL model, called (MI-SVM). We do not present results of MI-SVM on the histopathology datasets since we could not train (including hyperparameter search and five times 10-fold-crossvalidation procedure) the model in a reasonable amount of time. 3 In order to compare the bag level performance we use the following metrics: the classification accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\",\n",
       " 'Classical MIL datasets Details In the first experiment we aim at verifying whether our approach can compete with the best MIL methods on historically important benchmark datasets. Since all five datasets contain precomputed features and only a small number of instances and bags, neural networks are most likely not well suited. First we predict drug activity (MUSK1 and MUSK2). A molecule has the desired drug effect if and only if one or more of its conformations bind to the target binding site. Since molecules can adopt multiple shapes, a bag is made up of shapes belonging to the same molecule (Dietterich et al., 1997) . The three remaining datasets, ELE-PHANT, FOX and TIGER, contain features extracted from images. Each bag consists of a set of segments of an image. For each category, positive bags are images that contain the animal of interest, and negative bags are images that contain other animals (Andrews et al., 2003) . For detailed information on the number of bags, instances and features in each dataset see Section 6.3 in the Appendix. In our experiments we use the same architecture, optimizer and hyperparameters as in the MI-Net model (Wang et al., 2016) . presented in Table 1 . Our approaches (Attention and Gated-Attention) are comparable with the best performing classical MIL methods (notice the standard error of the mean).',\n",
       " \"MNIST-bags Details The main disadvantage of the classical MIL benchmark datasets is that instances are represented by precomputed features. In order to consider a more challenging scenario, we propose to investigate a dataset that is created using the well-known MNIST image dataset. A bag is made up of a random number of 28 × 28 grayscale images taken from the MNIST dataset. The number of images in a bag is Gaussian-distributed and the closest integer value is taken. A bag is given a positive label if it contains one or more images with the label '9'. We chose '9' since it can be easily mistaken with '7' or '4'. We investigate the influence of the number of bags in the training set as well as the average number of instances per bag on the prediction performance. During evaluation we use a fixed number of 1000 test bags. For all experiments a LeNet5 model is used (LeCun et al., 1998) , see Table 8 and 9 in the Appendix. The models are trained with the Adam optimization algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014) . We keep the default parameters for β 1 and β 2 , see Table 10 in the Appendix. In addition, we compare our method with a SVM-based MIL method (MI-SVM) (Andrews et al., 2003) that uses a Gaussian kernel on raw pixel features 4 . In the experiments we use different numbers of the mean bag size, namely, 10, 50 and 100, and the variance 2, 10, 20, respectively. Moreover, we use varying numbers of training bags, i.e., 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500. These different settings allow us to verify how different number of training bags and different number of instances influence MIL models. We compare instance-based and embedding-based approaches parameterized with a neural network (LeNet5) with mean and max MIL pooling. We use AUC as the evaluation metric.\",\n",
       " 'Results and discussion The results of AUC for the mean bag sizes equal to 10, 50 and 100 are presented in Figure 1 , 2 and 3, respectively, and detailed results are given in the Appendix. The findings of the experiment are the following: First, the proposed attention-based deep MIL approach performs much better than other methods in the small sample size regime. Moreover, when there is a small effective size of the training set that corresponds to 50-150 bags for around 10 instances per bag (see Figure 1 ) or 50-100 bags in the case of on average 50 instances in a bag (see Figure  2 ), our method still achieves significantly higher AUC than all other methods. Second, we notice that our approach is more flexible and obtained better results than the SVM-   based approach in all cases except large effective sample sizes (see Figure 3) . Third, the embedding-based models performed better than the instance-based models. However, for a sufficient number of training images (number of training bags and training instances per bag) all models achieve very similar results. Fourth, the mean operator performs significantly worse than the max operator. However, the embedding-based model with the mean operator converged eventually to the best value but always later than the one with max. See Section 6.4 in the Appendix for details. The results of this experiment indicate that for a smallsample size regime our approach is preferable to others. Since attention serves as a gradient update filter during backpropagation (Wang et al., 2017) , instances with higher weights will contribute more to learning the encoder network of instances. This is especially important since medical imaging problems contain only a small number of cases. In general, the more instances are in a bag the easier the MIL task becomes, since the MIL assumption states that every instance in a negative bag is negative. For example, a negative bag of size 100 from the MNIST-bags dataset will include about 11 negative examples per class. Finally, we present an exemplary result of the attention mechanism in Figure 4 . In this example a bag consists of 13 images. For each digit the corresponding attention weight is given by the trained network. The bag is properly predicted as positive and all nines are correctly highlighted. Hence, the attention mechanism works as expected. More examples are given in the Appendix.',\n",
       " 'Histopathology datasets Details An automatic detection of cancerous regions in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images is a task with high clinical relevance. Current supervised approaches utilize pixel-level annotations (Litjens et al., 2017) . However, data preparation requires large amount of time from pathologists which highly interferes with their daily routines. Hence, a successful solution working with weak labels would hold a great promise to reduce the workload of the pathologists. In the following, we perform two experiments on classifying weakly-labeled real-life histopathol-ogy images of the breast cancer dataset (BREAST CANCER) (Gelasca et al., 2008) and the colon cancer dataset (COLON CANCER) (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) . BREAST CANCER consists of 58 weakly labeled 896 × 768 H&E images. An image is labeled malignant if it contains breast cancer cells, otherwise it is benign. We divide every image into 32 × 32 patches. This results in 672 patches per bag. A patch is discarded if it contains 75% or more of white pixels. COLON CANCER comprises 100 H&E images. The images originate from a variety of tissue appearance from both normal and malignant regions. For every image the majority of nuclei of each cell were marked. In total there are 22,444 nuclei with associated class label, i.e. epithelial, inflammatory, fibroblast, and miscellaneous. A bag is composed of 27 × 27 patches. Furthermore, a bag is given a positive label if it contains one or more nuclei from the epithelial class. Tagging epithelial cells is highly relevant from a clinical point of view, since colon cancer originates from epithelial cells (Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2007) . For both datasets we use the model proposed in (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) for the transformation f . All models are trained with the Adam optimization algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014) . Due to the limited amount of data samples in both datasets we performed data augmentation to prevent overfitting. See the Appendix for further details. Results and discussion We present results in Table 2 and 3 for BREAST CANCER and COLON CANCER, respectively. First, we notice that the obtained results confirm our findings in MNIST-BAGS experiment that our approach outperforms all other methods. A trend that is especially visible in the small-sample size regime of the MNIST-BAGS. Surprisingly, the embedding-based method with the max pooling failed almost completely on BREAST CANCER but in general this dataset is difficult due to high variability of slides and small number of cases. The proposed method is not only most accurate but it also received the highest recall. High recall is especially important in the medical domain since false negatives could lead to severe consequences including patient fatality. We also notice that the gated-attention mechanism performs better than the plain attention mechanism on BREAST CANCER while these two behave similarly on COLON CANCER. Eventually, we present the usefulness of the attention mechanism in providing ROIs. In Figure 5 we show a histopathology image divided into patches containing (mostly) single cells. We create a heatmap by multiplying patches by its corresponding attention weight. Although only image-level annotations are used during training, there is a substantial matching between the heatmap in Figure 5 (d) and the ground truth in Figure 5(c) . Additionally, we notice that Table 2 . Results on BREAST CANCER. Experiments were run 5 times and an average (± a standard error of the mean) is reported. the instance-based classifier tends to select only a small subset of positive patches (see Figure 10 (e) in Appendix) that confirms low instance accuracy of the instance-based approach discussed in (Kandemir & Hamprecht, 2015) . For more examples please see the Appendix.',\n",

We showed empirically on five MIL datasets, one image corpora and two real-life histopathology datasets that our method is on a par with the best performing methods or performs the best in terms of different evaluation metrics. Additionally, we showed that our approach provides an interpretation of the decision by presenting ROIs, which is extremely important in many practical applications. We strongly believe that the presented line of research is worth pursuing further. Here we focused on a binary MIL problem, however, the multi-class MIL is more interesting and challenging .

However, in many real-life applications multiple instances are observed and only a general statement of the category is given. This scenario is called multiple instance learning (MIL)\\n      <ref target=\"#b6\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Dietterich et al., 1997;\\n      </ref>\\n      <ref target=\"#b23\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       Maron &amp; Lozano-Pérez, 1998)\\n      </ref>\\n      or, learning from weakly annotated data\\n      <ref target=\"#b24\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Oquab et al., 2014)\\n      </ref>\\n      .

In the medical domain the latter task is of great interest because of legal issues 1 and its usefulness in clinical practice. In order to solve the primary task of a bag classification different methods are proposed, such as utilizing similarities among bags\\n      <ref target=\"#b4\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Cheplygina et al., 2015b)\\n      </ref>\\n      , embedding instances to a compact low-dimensional representation that is further fed to a bag-level classifier\\n      <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Andrews et al., 2003;\\n      </ref>\\n      <ref target=\"#b2\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       Chen et al., 2006)\\n      </ref>\\n      , and combining responses of an instance-level classifier\\n      <ref target=\"#b31\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Ramon &amp; De Raedt, 2000;\\n      </ref>\\n      <ref target=\"#b32\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       Raykar et al., 2008;\\n      </ref>\\n      <ref target=\"#b42\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       Zhang et al., 2006)\\n      </ref>\\n      . Only the last approach is capable of providing interpretable results. However, it was shown that the instance level accuracy of such methods is low\\n      <ref target=\"#b13\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Kandemir &amp; Hamprecht, 2015)\\n      </ref>\\n      and in general there is a disagreement among MIL methods at the instance level\\n      <ref target=\"#b3\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Cheplygina et al., 2015a)\\n      </ref>\\n      . These issues call into question the usability of current MIL models for interpreting the final decision.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      In this paper, we propose a new method that aims at incorporating interpretability to the MIL approach and increasing its flexibility. We formulate the MIL model using the Bernoulli distribution for the bag label and train it by optimizing the log-likelihood function. We show that the application of the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions provides a general procedure for modeling the bag label probability (the bag score function) that consists of three steps: (i) a transformation of instances to a low-dimensional embedding, (ii) a permutation-invariant (symmetric) aggregation function, and (iii) a final transformation to the bag probability. We propose to parameterize all transformations using neural networks (i.e., a combination of convolutional and fully-connected layers), which increases the flexibility of the approach and allows to train the model in an endto-end manner by optimizing an unconstrained objective function. Last but not least, we propose to replace widelyused permutation-invariant operators such as the maximum operator max and the mean operator mean by a trainable weighted average where weights are given by a two-layered neural network. The two-layered neural network corre-sponds to the attention mechanism\\n      <ref target=\"#b1\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Bahdanau et al., 2014;\\n      </ref>\\n      <ref target=\"#b30\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       Raffel &amp; Ellis, 2015)\\n      </ref>\\n      . Notably, the attention weights allow us to find key instances, which could be further used to highlight possible ROIs. In the experiments we show that our model is on a par with the best classical MIL methods on common benchmark MIL datasets, and that it outperforms other methods on a MNIST-based MIL problem as well as two real-life histopathology image datasets. Moreover, in the image datasets we provide empirical evidence that our model can indicate key instances.\\n     </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">\\n     Methodology\\n    </div>\\n    <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">\\n     Multiple instance learning (MIL)\\n     <p>\\n      Problem formulation In the classical (binary) supervised learning problem one aims at finding a model that predicts a value of a target variable, y ∈ {0, 1}, for a given instance, x ∈ R D . In the case of the MIL problem, however, instead of a single instance there is a bag of instances, X = {x 1 , . . . , x K }, that exhibit neither dependency nor ordering among each other. We assume that K could vary for different bags. There is also a single binary label Y associated with the bag. Furthermore, we assume that individual labels exist for the instances within a bag, i.e., y 1 , . . . , y K and y k ∈ {0, 1}, for k = 1, . . . , K, however, there is no access to those labels and they remain unknown during training. We can re-write the assumptions of the MIL problem in the following form:\\n     </p>\\n     <formula xml:id=\"formula_0\">\\n      Y = 0, iff k y k = 0, 1, otherwise.\\n      <label>\\n       (1)\\n      </label>\\n     </formula>\\n     <p>\\n      These assumptions imply that a MIL model must be permutation-invariant. Further, the two statements could be re-formulated in a compact form using the maximum operator:\\n     </p>\\n     <formula xml:id=\"formula_1\">\\n      Y = max k {y k }.\\n      <label>\\n       (2)\\n      </label>\\n     </formula>\\n     <p>\\n      Learning a model that tries to optimize an objective based on the maximum over instance labels would be problematic at least for two reasons. First, all gradient-based learning methods would encounter issues with vanishing gradients. Second, this formulation is suitable only when an instancelevel classifier is used.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      In order to make the learning problem easier, we propose to train a MIL model by optimizing the log-likelihood function where the bag label is distributed according to the Bernoulli distribution with the parameter θ(X) ∈ [0, 1], i.e., the probability of Y = 1 given the bag of instances X.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      MIL approaches In the MIL setting the bag probability θ(X) must be permutation-invariant since we assume neither ordering nor dependency of instances within a bag. Therefore, the MIL problem can be considered in terms of a specific form of the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions with monomials given by the following theorem\\n      <ref target=\"#b41\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Zaheer et al., 2017)\\n      </ref>\\n      :\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      Theorem 1. A scoring function for a set of instances X, S(X) ∈ R, is a symmetric function (i.e., permutationinvariant to the elements in X), if and only if it can be decomposed in the following form:\\n     </p>\\n     <formula xml:id=\"formula_2\">\\n      S(X) = g x∈X f (x) ,\\n      <label>\\n       (3)\\n      </label>\\n     </formula>\\n     <p>\\n      where f and g are suitable transformations.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      This theorem provides a general strategy for modeling the bag probability using the decomposition given in\\n      <ref target=\"#formula_2\" type=\"formula\">\\n       (3)\\n      </ref>\\n      . A similar decomposition with max instead of sum is given by the following theorem :\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      Theorem 2. For any ε &gt; 0, a Hausdorff continuous symmetric function S(X) ∈ R can be arbitrarily approximated by a function in the form g max x∈X f (x) , where max is the element-wise vector maximum operator and f and g are continuous functions, that is:\\n     </p>\\n     <formula xml:id=\"formula_3\">\\n      |S(X) − g max x∈X f (x) | &lt; ε.\\n      <label>\\n       (4)\\n      </label>\\n     </formula>\\n     <p>\\n      The difference between Theorems 1 and 2 is that the former is a universal decomposition while the latter provides an arbitrary approximation. Nonetheless, they both formulate a general three-step approach for classifying a bag of instances: (i) a transformation of instances using the function f , (ii) a combination of transformed instances using a symmetric (permutation-invariant) function σ, (iii) a transformation of combined instances transformed by f using a function g. Finally, the expressiveness of the score function relies on the choice of classes of functions for f and g.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      In the MIL problem formulation the score function in both theorems is the probability θ(X) and the permutationinvariant function σ is referred to as the MIL pooling. The choice of functions f , g and σ determines a specific approach to modeling the label probability. For a given MIL operator there are two main MIL approaches:\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      (i) The instance-level approach: The transformation f is an instance-level classifier that returns scores for each instance. Then individual scores are aggregated by MIL pooling to obtain θ(X). The function g is the identity function.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      (ii) The embedding-level approach: The function f maps instances to a low-dimensional embedding. MIL pooling is used to obtain a bag representation that is independent of the number of instances in the bag. The bag representation is further processed by a bag-level classifier to provide θ(X).\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      It is advocated in\\n      <ref target=\"#b38\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Wang et al., 2016)\\n      </ref>\\n      that the latter approach is preferable in terms of the bag level classification performance. Since the individual labels are unknown, there is a threat that the instance-level classifier might be trained insufficiently and it introduces additional error to the final prediction. The embedding-level approach determines a joint representation of a bag and therefore it does not introduce additional bias to the bag-level classifier. On the other hand, the instance-level approach provides a score that can be used to find key instances i.e., the instances that trigger the bag label.\\n      <ref target=\"#b22\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       Liu et al. (2012)\\n      </ref>\\n      were able to show that a model that is successfully detecting key instances is more likely to achieve better bag label predictions. We will show how to modify the embedding-level approach to be interpretable by using a new MIL pooling.\\n     </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">\\n     MIL with Neural Networks\\n     <p>\\n      In classical MIL problems it is assumed that instances are represented by features that do not require further processing, i.e., f is the identity. However, for some tasks like image or text analysis additional steps of feature extraction are necessary. Additionally, Theorem 1 and 2 indicate that for a flexible enough class of functions we can model any permutation-invariant score function. Therefore, we consider a class of transformations that are parameterized by neural networks f ψ (·) with parameters ψ that transform the k-th instance into a low-dimensional embedding, h k = f ψ (x k ), where h k ∈ H such that H = [0, 1] for the instance-based approach and H = R M for the embeddingbased approach.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      Eventually, the parameter θ(X) is determined by a transformation g φ : H K → [0, 1]. In the instance-based approach the transformation g φ is simply the identity, while in the embedding-based approach it could be also parameterized by a neural network with parameters φ. The former approach is depicted in\\n      <ref type=\"figure\">\\n       Figure 6\\n      </ref>\\n      (a) and the latter in\\n      <ref type=\"figure\">\\n       Figure  6\\n      </ref>\\n      (b) in the Appendix.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      The idea of parameterizing all transformations using neural networks is very appealing because the whole approach can be arbitrarily flexible and it can be trained end-to-end by backpropagation. The only restriction is that the MIL pooling must be differentiable.\\n     </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">\\n     MIL pooling\\n     <p>\\n      The formulation of the MIL problem requires the MIL pooling σ to be permutation-invariant. As shown in Theorem 1 and 2, there are two MIL pooling operators that ensure the score function (i.e., the bag probability) to be a symmetric function, namely, the maximum operator:\\n     </p>\\n     <formula xml:id=\"formula_4\">\\n      ∀ m=1,...,M : z m = max k=1,...,K {h km },\\n      <label>\\n       (5)\\n      </label>\\n     </formula>\\n     <p>\\n      and the mean operator: 2\\n     </p>\\n     <formula xml:id=\"formula_5\">\\n      z = 1 K K k=1 h k .\\n      <label>\\n       (6)\\n      </label>\\n     </formula>\\n     <p>\\n      In fact, other operators could be used such as, the convex maximum operator (i.e., log-sum-exp)\\n      <ref target=\"#b31\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Ramon &amp; De Raedt, 2000)\\n      </ref>\\n      , Integrated Segmentation and Recognition\\n      <ref target=\"#b16\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Keeler et al., 1991)\\n      </ref>\\n      , noisy-or\\n      <ref target=\"#b23\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Maron &amp; Lozano-Pérez, 1998\\n      </ref>\\n      ) and noisy-and\\n      <ref target=\"#b18\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Kraus et al., 2016)\\n      </ref>\\n      . These MIL pooling operators could replace max in Theorem 2 and proofs would follow in a similar manner (see Supplementary in  for a detailed proof for the maximum operator). All of these operators are differentiable, hence, they could be easily used as a MIL pooling layer in a deep neural network architecture.\\n     </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">\\n     Attention-based MIL pooling\\n     <p>\\n      All MIL pooling operators mentioned in the previous section have a clear disadvantage, namely, they are pre-defined and non-trainable. For instance, the max-operator could be a good choice in the instance-based approach but it might be inappropriate for the embedding-based approach. Similarly, the mean operator is definitely a bad MIL pooling to aggregate instance scores, although, it could succeed in calculating the bag representation. Therefore, a flexible and adaptive MIL pooling could potentially achieve better results by adjusting to a task and data. Ideally, such MIL pooling should also be interpretable, a trait that is missing in all operators mentioned in Section 2.3.\\n     </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">\\n     Attention mechanism\\n     <p>\\n      We propose to use a weighted average of instances (low-dimensional embeddings) where weights are determined by a neural network. Additionally, the weights must sum to 1 to be invariant to the size of a bag. The weighted average fulfills the requirements of the Theorem 1 where the weights together with the embeddings are part of the f function. Let H = {h 1 , . . . , h K } be a bag of K embeddings, then we propose the following MIL pooling:\\n     </p>\\n     <formula xml:id=\"formula_6\">\\n      z = K k=1 a k h k ,\\n      <label>\\n       (7)\\n      </label>\\n     </formula>\\n     <p>\\n      where:\\n     </p>\\n     <formula xml:id=\"formula_7\">\\n      a k = exp{w tanh Vh k } K j=1 exp{w tanh Vh j } ,\\n      <label>\\n       (8)\\n      </label>\\n     </formula>\\n     <p>\\n      where w ∈ R L×1 and V ∈ R L×M are parameters. Moreover, we utilize the hyperbolic tangent tanh(·) element-wise non-linearity to include both negative and positive values for proper gradient flow. The proposed construction allows to discover (dis)similarities among instances.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      Interestingly, the proposed MIL pooling corresponds to a version of the attention mechanism\\n      <ref target=\"#b20\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Lin et al., 2017;\\n      </ref>\\n      <ref target=\"#b30\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       Raffel &amp; Ellis, 2015)\\n      </ref>\\n      . The main difference is that typically in the attention mechanism all instances are sequentially dependent while here we assume that all instances are independent. Therefore, a naturally arising question is whether the attention mechanism could work without sequential dependencies among instances, and if it will not learn the mean operator. We will address this issue in the experiments.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      Gated attention mechanism Furthermore, we notice that the tanh(·) non-linearity could be inefficient to learn complex relations. Our concern follows from the fact that tanh(x) is approximately linear for x ∈ [−1, 1], which could limit the final expressiveness of learned relations among instances. Therefore, we propose to additionally use the gating mechanism\\n      <ref target=\"#b5\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Dauphin et al., 2016)\\n      </ref>\\n      together with tanh(·) non-linearity that yields:\\n     </p>\\n     <formula xml:id=\"formula_8\">\\n      a k = exp{w tanh Vh k sigm Uh k } K j=1 exp{w tanh Vh j ) sigm Uh j } ,\\n      <label>\\n       (9)\\n      </label>\\n     </formula>\\n     <p>\\n      where U ∈ R L×M are parameters, is an element-wise multiplication and sigm(·) is the sigmoid non-linearity. The gating mechanism introduces a learnable non-linearity that potentially removes the troublesome linearity in tanh(·).\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      Flexibility In principle, the proposed attention-based MIL pooling allows to assign different weights to instances within a bag and hence the final representation of the bag could be highly informative for the bag-level classifier. In other words, it should be able to find key instances. Moreover, application of the attention-based MIL pooling together with the transformations f and g parameterized by neural networks makes the whole model fully differentiable and adaptive. These two facts make the proposed MIL pooling a potentially very flexible operator that could model an arbitrary permutation-invariant score function. The proposed attention mechanism together with a deep MIL model is depicted in\\n      <ref type=\"figure\">\\n       Figure 6\\n      </ref>\\n      (c) in the Appendix.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      Interpretability Ideally, in the case of a positive label (Y = 1), high attention weights should be assigned to instances that are likely to have label y k = 1 (key instances). Namely, the attention mechanism allows to easily interpret the provided decision in terms of instance-level labels. In fact, the attention network does not provide scores as the instance-based classifier does but it can be considered as a proxy to that. The attention-based MIL pooling bridges the instance-level approach and the embedding-level approach.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      From the practical point of view, e.g., in the computational pathology, it is desirable to provide ROIs together with the final diagnosis to a doctor. Therefore, the attention mechanism is potentially of great interest in practical applications.\\n     </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">\\n     Related work\\n     <p>\\n      MIL pooling Typically, MIL approaches utilize either the mean pooling or the max pooling, while the latter is mostly used\\n      <ref target=\"#b27\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       Pinheiro &amp; Collobert, 2015;\\n      </ref>\\n      <ref target=\"#b45\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       Zhu et al., 2017)\\n      </ref>\\n      . Both operators are non-trainable which potentially limits their applicability. There are MIL pooling operators that contain global adaptive parameters, such as noisy-and\\n      <ref target=\"#b18\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Kraus et al., 2016)\\n      </ref>\\n      , however, their flexibility is restricted. We propose a fully trainable MIL pooling that adapts to new instances.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      MIL with neural networks In the classical work on MIL it is assumed that instances are represented by precomputed features and there is very little need to apply additional feature extraction. Nevertheless, recent work on utilizing fully-connected neural networks in MIL shows that it could still be beneficial\\n      <ref target=\"#b38\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Wang et al., 2016)\\n      </ref>\\n      .

In this paper, we follow this line of research since it allows to apply a flexible class of transformations that can be trained end-to-end by backpropagation.\\n     </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">\\n     MIL and attention\\n     <p>\\n      The attention mechanism is widely used in deep learning for image captioning\\n      <ref target=\"#b40\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Xu et al., 2015)\\n      </ref>\\n      or text analysis\\n      <ref target=\"#b1\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Bahdanau et al., 2014;\\n      </ref>\\n      <ref target=\"#b20\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       Lin et al., 2017)\\n      </ref>\\n      . In the context of the MIL problem it has rarely been used and only in a very limited form.

This idea was further expanded and the linear regression model was replaced by a one-layer neural network with single output\\n      <ref target=\"#b26\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Pappas &amp; Popescu-Belis, 2017)\\n      </ref>\\n      . The attention-based MIL operator was used very recently in , however, the attention was calculated using the dot product and it performed worse than the max operator. Here, we propose to use a two-layered neural network to learn the MIL operator and we show that it outperforms commonly used MIL pooling operators.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      MIL for medical imaging The MIL seems to perfectly fit medical imaging where processing a whole image consisting of billions of pixels is computationally infeasible. Moreover, in the medical domain it is very difficult to obtain pixel-level annotations, that drastically reduces number of available data. Therefore, it is tempting to divide a medical image into smaller patches that could be further considered as a bag with a single label\\n      <ref target=\"#b29\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Quellec et al., 2017)\\n      </ref>\\n      . This idea attracts a great interest in the computational histopathology where patches could correspond to cells that are believed to indicate malignant changes\\n      <ref target=\"#b36\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016)\\n      </ref>\\n      . Different MIL approaches were used for histopathology data, such as, Gaussian processes\\n      <ref target=\"#b14\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Kandemir et al., 2014;\\n      </ref>\\n      or a two-stage approach with neural networks and EM algorithm to determine instance classes\\n      <ref target=\"#b12\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Hou et al., 2016)\\n      </ref>\\n      .\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      Other applications of MIL methods in medical imaging are mammography (nodule) classification\\n      <ref target=\"#b45\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Zhu et al., 2017)\\n      </ref>\\n      and microscopy cell detection\\n      <ref target=\"#b18\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Kraus et al., 2016)\\n      </ref>\\n      . In this paper, we show that the proposed attention-based deep MIL approach can be used not only to provide the final diagnosis but also to indicate ROIs in a histopathology slide.\\n     </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">\\n     Experiments\\n     <p>\\n      In the experiments we aim at evaluating the proposed approach: a MIL model parameterized with neural networks and a (gated) attention-based pooling layer (\\'Attention\\' and \\'Gated-Attention\\'). We evaluate our approach on a number of different MIL datasets: five MIL benchmark datasets (MUSK1, MUSK2, FOX, TIGER, ELEPHANT), an MNIST-based image dataset (MNIST-BAGS) and two reallife histopathology datasets (BREAST CANCER, COLON CANCER). We want to verify two research questions in the experiments: (i) whether our approach achieves the best performance or is comparable to the best performing method, (ii) if our method can provide interpretable results by using the attention weights that indicate key instances or ROIs.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      In order to obtain a fair comparison we use a common evaluation methodology, i.e., 10-fold-cross-validation, and five repetitions per experiment. In the case of MNIST-BAGS we use a fixed division into training and test set. In order to create test bags we solely sampled images from the MNIST test set. During training we only used images from the MNIST training set. For all experiments we use modified versions of models that have shown high classification performance on the individual datasets\\n      <ref target=\"#b38\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Wang et al., 2016;\\n      </ref>\\n      <ref target=\"#b19\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       LeCun et al., 1998;\\n      </ref>\\n      <ref target=\"#b36\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016)\\n      </ref>\\n      . The MIL pooling layers are either located before the last layer of the model (the embedded-based approach) or after last layer of the model (the instance-based approach). If an attention-based MIL pooling layer is used the number of parameters in V was determined using a validation set. We tested the following dimensions (L): 64, 128 and 256. The different dimensions only resulted in minor changes of the model\\'s performance. For layers using the gated attention mechanism V and U have the same number of parameters. Finally, all layers were initialized according to\\n      <ref target=\"#b11\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       Glorot &amp; Bengio (2010)\\n      </ref>\\n      and biases were set to zero.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      We compare our approach to various MIL methods on MIL benchmark datasets. On the image datasets our method is compared with instance-level and embedding-level neural networks and commonly used MIL pooling layers (max and mean). In the following, we are using \\'Instance+max/mean\\' and \\'Embedding+max/mean\\' to indicate networks that are build from convolutional layers and fully-connected layers.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      In contrast to networks purely build from fully-connected layers, referred to as \\'mi-Net\\' and \\'MI-Net\\'\\n      <ref target=\"#b38\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Wang et al., 2016)\\n      </ref>\\n      .\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      On MNIST-BAGS we include a SVM-based MIL model, called (MI-SVM). We do not present results of MI-SVM on the histopathology datasets since we could not train (including hyperparameter search and five times 10-fold-crossvalidation procedure) the model in a reasonable amount of time.\\n      <ref type=\"bibr\">\\n       3\\n      </ref>\\n      In order to compare the bag level performance we use the following metrics: the classification accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\\n     </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">\\n     Classical MIL datasets\\n     <p>\\n      Details In the first experiment we aim at verifying whether our approach can compete with the best MIL methods on historically important benchmark datasets. Since all five datasets contain precomputed features and only a small number of instances and bags, neural networks are most likely not well suited. First we predict drug activity (MUSK1 and MUSK2). A molecule has the desired drug effect if and only if one or more of its conformations bind to the target binding site. Since molecules can adopt multiple shapes, a bag is made up of shapes belonging to the same molecule\\n      <ref target=\"#b6\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Dietterich et al., 1997)\\n      </ref>\\n      . The three remaining datasets, ELE-PHANT, FOX and TIGER, contain features extracted from images. Each bag consists of a set of segments of an image. For each category, positive bags are images that contain the animal of interest, and negative bags are images that contain other animals\\n      <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Andrews et al., 2003)\\n      </ref>\\n      . For detailed information on the number of bags, instances and features in each dataset see Section 6.3 in the Appendix.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      In our experiments we use the same architecture, optimizer and hyperparameters as in the MI-Net model\\n      <ref target=\"#b38\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Wang et al., 2016)\\n      </ref>\\n      . presented in\\n      <ref target=\"#tab_0\" type=\"table\">\\n       Table 1\\n      </ref>\\n      . Our approaches (Attention and Gated-Attention) are comparable with the best performing classical MIL methods (notice the standard error of the mean).\\n     </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">\\n     MNIST-bags\\n     <p>\\n      Details The main disadvantage of the classical MIL benchmark datasets is that instances are represented by precomputed features. In order to consider a more challenging scenario, we propose to investigate a dataset that is created using the well-known MNIST image dataset. A bag is made up of a random number of 28 × 28 grayscale images taken from the MNIST dataset. The number of images in a bag is Gaussian-distributed and the closest integer value is taken. A bag is given a positive label if it contains one or more images with the label \\'9\\'. We chose \\'9\\' since it can be easily mistaken with \\'7\\' or \\'4\\'. We investigate the influence of the number of bags in the training set as well as the average number of instances per bag on the prediction performance. During evaluation we use a fixed number of 1000 test bags. For all experiments a LeNet5 model is used\\n      <ref target=\"#b19\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (LeCun et al., 1998)\\n      </ref>\\n      , see\\n      <ref target=\"#tab_4\" type=\"table\">\\n       Table 8\\n      </ref>\\n      and 9 in the Appendix. The models are trained with the Adam optimization algorithm\\n      <ref target=\"#b17\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Kingma &amp; Ba, 2014)\\n      </ref>\\n      . We keep the default parameters for β 1 and β 2 , see\\n      <ref target=\"#tab_0\" type=\"table\">\\n       Table 10\\n      </ref>\\n      in the Appendix. In addition, we compare our method with a SVM-based MIL method (MI-SVM)\\n      <ref target=\"#b0\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Andrews et al., 2003)\\n      </ref>\\n      that uses a Gaussian kernel on raw pixel features 4 .\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      In the experiments we use different numbers of the mean bag size, namely, 10, 50 and 100, and the variance 2, 10, 20, respectively. Moreover, we use varying numbers of training bags, i.e., 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500. These different settings allow us to verify how different number of training bags and different number of instances influence MIL models. We compare instance-based and embedding-based approaches parameterized with a neural network (LeNet5) with mean and max MIL pooling. We use AUC as the evaluation metric.\\n     </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">\\n     Results and discussion\\n     <p>\\n      The results of AUC for the mean bag sizes equal to 10, 50 and 100 are presented in\\n      <ref target=\"#fig_0\" type=\"figure\">\\n       Figure 1\\n      </ref>\\n      , 2 and 3, respectively, and detailed results are given in the Appendix. The findings of the experiment are the following: First, the proposed attention-based deep MIL approach performs much better than other methods in the small sample size regime. Moreover, when there is a small effective size of the training set that corresponds to 50-150 bags for around 10 instances per bag (see\\n      <ref target=\"#fig_0\" type=\"figure\">\\n       Figure 1\\n      </ref>\\n      ) or 50-100 bags in the case of on average 50 instances in a bag (see\\n      <ref target=\"#fig_1\" type=\"figure\">\\n       Figure  2\\n      </ref>\\n      ), our method still achieves significantly higher AUC than all other methods. Second, we notice that our approach is more flexible and obtained better results than the SVM-   based approach in all cases except large effective sample sizes (see\\n      <ref target=\"#fig_2\" type=\"figure\">\\n       Figure 3)\\n      </ref>\\n      . Third, the embedding-based models performed better than the instance-based models. However, for a sufficient number of training images (number of training bags and training instances per bag) all models achieve very similar results. Fourth, the mean operator performs significantly worse than the max operator. However, the embedding-based model with the mean operator converged eventually to the best value but always later than the one with max. See Section 6.4 in the Appendix for details.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      The results of this experiment indicate that for a smallsample size regime our approach is preferable to others. Since attention serves as a gradient update filter during backpropagation\\n      <ref target=\"#b37\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Wang et al., 2017)\\n      </ref>\\n      , instances with higher weights will contribute more to learning the encoder network of instances. This is especially important since medical imaging problems contain only a small number of cases. In general, the more instances are in a bag the easier the MIL task becomes, since the MIL assumption states that every instance in a negative bag is negative. For example, a negative bag of size 100 from the MNIST-bags dataset will include about 11 negative examples per class.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      Finally, we present an exemplary result of the attention mechanism in\\n      <ref target=\"#fig_4\" type=\"figure\">\\n       Figure 4\\n      </ref>\\n      . In this example a bag consists of 13 images. For each digit the corresponding attention weight is given by the trained network. The bag is properly predicted as positive and all nines are correctly highlighted. Hence, the attention mechanism works as expected. More examples are given in the Appendix.\\n     </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">\\n     Histopathology datasets\\n     <p>\\n      Details An automatic detection of cancerous regions in hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained whole-slide images is a task with high clinical relevance. Current supervised approaches utilize pixel-level annotations\\n      <ref target=\"#b21\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Litjens et al., 2017)\\n      </ref>\\n      . However, data preparation requires large amount of time from pathologists which highly interferes with their daily routines. Hence, a successful solution working with weak labels would hold a great promise to reduce the workload of the pathologists. In the following, we perform two experiments on classifying weakly-labeled real-life histopathol-ogy images of the breast cancer dataset (BREAST CANCER)\\n      <ref target=\"#b10\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Gelasca et al., 2008)\\n      </ref>\\n      and the colon cancer dataset (COLON CANCER)\\n      <ref target=\"#b36\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016)\\n      </ref>\\n      .\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      BREAST CANCER consists of 58 weakly labeled 896 × 768 H&amp;E images. An image is labeled malignant if it contains breast cancer cells, otherwise it is benign. We divide every image into 32 × 32 patches. This results in 672 patches per bag. A patch is discarded if it contains 75% or more of white pixels.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      COLON CANCER comprises 100 H&amp;E images. The images originate from a variety of tissue appearance from both normal and malignant regions. For every image the majority of nuclei of each cell were marked. In total there are 22,444 nuclei with associated class label, i.e. epithelial, inflammatory, fibroblast, and miscellaneous. A bag is composed of 27 × 27 patches. Furthermore, a bag is given a positive label if it contains one or more nuclei from the epithelial class. Tagging epithelial cells is highly relevant from a clinical point of view, since colon cancer originates from epithelial cells\\n      <ref target=\"#b33\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2007)\\n      </ref>\\n      .\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      For both datasets we use the model proposed in\\n      <ref target=\"#b36\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016)\\n      </ref>\\n      for the transformation f .

Due to the limited amount of data samples in both datasets we performed data augmentation to prevent overfitting. See the Appendix for further details.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      Results and discussion We present results in\\n      <ref type=\"table\">\\n       Table 2 and 3\\n      </ref>\\n      for BREAST CANCER and COLON CANCER, respectively. First, we notice that the obtained results confirm our findings in MNIST-BAGS experiment that our approach outperforms all other methods. A trend that is especially visible in the small-sample size regime of the MNIST-BAGS. Surprisingly, the embedding-based method with the max pooling failed almost completely on BREAST CANCER but in general this dataset is difficult due to high variability of slides and small number of cases. The proposed method is not only most accurate but it also received the highest recall. High recall is especially important in the medical domain since false negatives could lead to severe consequences including patient fatality. We also notice that the gated-attention mechanism performs better than the plain attention mechanism on BREAST CANCER while these two behave similarly on COLON CANCER.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      Eventually, we present the usefulness of the attention mechanism in providing ROIs. In\\n      <ref type=\"figure\">\\n       Figure 5\\n      </ref>\\n      we show a histopathology image divided into patches containing (mostly) single cells. We create a heatmap by multiplying patches by its corresponding attention weight. Although only image-level annotations are used during training, there is a substantial matching between the heatmap in\\n      <ref type=\"figure\">\\n       Figure 5\\n      </ref>\\n      (d) and the ground truth in\\n      <ref type=\"figure\">\\n       Figure 5(c)\\n      </ref>\\n      .

We outlined the usefulness of deep learning for modeling a permutation-invariant bag score function in terms of the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions. Moreover, we presented a trainable MIL pooling based on the (gated) attention mechanism. We showed empirically on five MIL datasets, one image corpora and two real-life histopathology datasets that our method is on a par with the best performing methods or performs the best in terms of different evaluation metrics. Additionally, we showed that our approach provides an interpretation of the decision by presenting ROIs, which is extremely important in many practical applications.\\n     </p>\\n     <p>\\n      We strongly believe that the presented line of research is worth pursuing further. Here we focused on a binary MIL problem, however, the multi-class MIL is more interesting and challenging . Moreover, in some applications it is worth to consider repulsion points\\n      <ref target=\"#b35\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Scott et al., 2005)\\n      </ref>\\n      , i.e., instances for which a bag is always negative, or assume dependencies among instances within a bag\\n      <ref target=\"#b44\" type=\"bibr\">\\n       (Zhou et al., 2009)\\n      </ref>\\n      .

       "   'In typical machine learning problems like image classification it is assumed that an image clearly represents a category (a class). However, in many real-life applications multiple instances are observed and only a general statement of the category is given. This scenario is called multiple instance learning (MIL) (Dietterich et al., 1997; Maron & Lozano-Pérez, 1998) or, learning from weakly annotated data (Oquab et al., 2014) . The problem of weakly annotated data is especially apparent in medical imaging (Quellec et al., 2017 ) (e.g., computational pathology, mammography or CT lung screening) where an image is typically described by a single label (benign/malignant) or a Region Of Interest (ROI) is roughly given. MIL deals with a bag of instances for which a single class label is assigned. Hence, the main goal of MIL is to learn a Proceedings of the 35 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Stockholm, Sweden, PMLR 80, 2018 . Copyright 2018 by the author(s). model that predicts a bag label, e.g., a medical diagnosis. An additional challenge is to discover key instances (Liu et al., 2012) , i.e., the instances that trigger the bag label. In the medical domain the latter task is of great interest because of legal issues 1 and its usefulness in clinical practice. In order to solve the primary task of a bag classification different methods are proposed, such as utilizing similarities among bags (Cheplygina et al., 2015b) , embedding instances to a compact low-dimensional representation that is further fed to a bag-level classifier (Andrews et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2006) , and combining responses of an instance-level classifier (Ramon & De Raedt, 2000; Raykar et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2006) . Only the last approach is capable of providing interpretable results. However, it was shown that the instance level accuracy of such methods is low (Kandemir & Hamprecht, 2015) and in general there is a disagreement among MIL methods at the instance level (Cheplygina et al., 2015a) . These issues call into question the usability of current MIL models for interpreting the final decision. In this paper, we propose a new method that aims at incorporating interpretability to the MIL approach and increasing its flexibility. We formulate the MIL model using the Bernoulli distribution for the bag label and train it by optimizing the log-likelihood function. We show that the application of the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions provides a general procedure for modeling the bag label probability (the bag score function) that consists of three steps: (i) a transformation of instances to a low-dimensional embedding, (ii) a permutation-invariant (symmetric) aggregation function, and (iii) a final transformation to the bag probability. We propose to parameterize all transformations using neural networks (i.e., a combination of convolutional and fully-connected layers), which increases the flexibility of the approach and allows to train the model in an endto-end manner by optimizing an unconstrained objective function. Last but not least, we propose to replace widelyused permutation-invariant operators such as the maximum operator max and the mean operator mean by a trainable weighted average where weights are given by a two-layered neural network. The two-layered neural network corre-sponds to the attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Raffel & Ellis, 2015) . Notably, the attention weights allow us to find key instances, which could be further used to highlight possible ROIs. In the experiments we show that our model is on a par with the best classical MIL methods on common benchmark MIL datasets, and that it outperforms other methods on a MNIST-based MIL problem as well as two real-life histopathology image datasets. Moreover, in the image datasets we provide empirical evidence that our model can indicate key instances.')],\n",

       "   'Problem formulation In the classical (binary) supervised learning problem one aims at finding a model that predicts a value of a target variable, y ∈ {0, 1}, for a given instance, x ∈ R D . In the case of the MIL problem, however, instead of a single instance there is a bag of instances, X = {x 1 , . . . , x K }, that exhibit neither dependency nor ordering among each other. We assume that K could vary for different bags. There is also a single binary label Y associated with the bag. Furthermore, we assume that individual labels exist for the instances within a bag, i.e., y 1 , . . . , y K and y k ∈ {0, 1}, for k = 1, . . . , K, however, there is no access to those labels and they remain unknown during training. We can re-write the assumptions of the MIL problem in the following form: Y = 0, iff k y k = 0, 1, otherwise. (1) These assumptions imply that a MIL model must be permutation-invariant. Further, the two statements could be re-formulated in a compact form using the maximum operator: Y = max k {y k }. (2) Learning a model that tries to optimize an objective based on the maximum over instance labels would be problematic at least for two reasons. First, all gradient-based learning methods would encounter issues with vanishing gradients. Second, this formulation is suitable only when an instancelevel classifier is used. In order to make the learning problem easier, we propose to train a MIL model by optimizing the log-likelihood function where the bag label is distributed according to the Bernoulli distribution with the parameter θ(X) ∈ [0, 1], i.e., the probability of Y = 1 given the bag of instances X. MIL approaches In the MIL setting the bag probability θ(X) must be permutation-invariant since we assume neither ordering nor dependency of instances within a bag. Therefore, the MIL problem can be considered in terms of a specific form of the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions with monomials given by the following theorem (Zaheer et al., 2017) : Theorem 1. A scoring function for a set of instances X, S(X) ∈ R, is a symmetric function (i.e., permutationinvariant to the elements in X), if and only if it can be decomposed in the following form: S(X) = g x∈X f (x) , (3) where f and g are suitable transformations. This theorem provides a general strategy for modeling the bag probability using the decomposition given in (3) . A similar decomposition with max instead of sum is given by the following theorem : Theorem 2. For any ε > 0, a Hausdorff continuous symmetric function S(X) ∈ R can be arbitrarily approximated by a function in the form g max x∈X f (x) , where max is the element-wise vector maximum operator and f and g are continuous functions, that is: |S(X) − g max x∈X f (x) | < ε. (4) The difference between Theorems 1 and 2 is that the former is a universal decomposition while the latter provides an arbitrary approximation. Nonetheless, they both formulate a general three-step approach for classifying a bag of instances: (i) a transformation of instances using the function f , (ii) a combination of transformed instances using a symmetric (permutation-invariant) function σ, (iii) a transformation of combined instances transformed by f using a function g. Finally, the expressiveness of the score function relies on the choice of classes of functions for f and g. In the MIL problem formulation the score function in both theorems is the probability θ(X) and the permutationinvariant function σ is referred to as the MIL pooling. The choice of functions f , g and σ determines a specific approach to modeling the label probability. For a given MIL operator there are two main MIL approaches: (i) The instance-level approach: The transformation f is an instance-level classifier that returns scores for each instance. Then individual scores are aggregated by MIL pooling to obtain θ(X). The function g is the identity function. (ii) The embedding-level approach: The function f maps instances to a low-dimensional embedding. MIL pooling is used to obtain a bag representation that is independent of the number of instances in the bag. The bag representation is further processed by a bag-level classifier to provide θ(X). It is advocated in (Wang et al., 2016) that the latter approach is preferable in terms of the bag level classification performance. Since the individual labels are unknown, there is a threat that the instance-level classifier might be trained insufficiently and it introduces additional error to the final prediction. The embedding-level approach determines a joint representation of a bag and therefore it does not introduce additional bias to the bag-level classifier. On the other hand, the instance-level approach provides a score that can be used to find key instances i.e., the instances that trigger the bag label. Liu et al. (2012) were able to show that a model that is successfully detecting key instances is more likely to achieve better bag label predictions. We will show how to modify the embedding-level approach to be interpretable by using a new MIL pooling.'),\n",
       "  ('MIL with Neural Networks',\n",
       "   'In classical MIL problems it is assumed that instances are represented by features that do not require further processing, i.e., f is the identity. However, for some tasks like image or text analysis additional steps of feature extraction are necessary. Additionally, Theorem 1 and 2 indicate that for a flexible enough class of functions we can model any permutation-invariant score function. Therefore, we consider a class of transformations that are parameterized by neural networks f ψ (·) with parameters ψ that transform the k-th instance into a low-dimensional embedding, h k = f ψ (x k ), where h k ∈ H such that H = [0, 1] for the instance-based approach and H = R M for the embeddingbased approach. Eventually, the parameter θ(X) is determined by a transformation g φ : H K → [0, 1]. In the instance-based approach the transformation g φ is simply the identity, while in the embedding-based approach it could be also parameterized by a neural network with parameters φ. The former approach is depicted in Figure 6 (a) and the latter in Figure  6 (b) in the Appendix. The idea of parameterizing all transformations using neural networks is very appealing because the whole approach can be arbitrarily flexible and it can be trained end-to-end by backpropagation. The only restriction is that the MIL pooling must be differentiable.'),\n",
       "  ('MIL pooling',\n",
       "   'The formulation of the MIL problem requires the MIL pooling σ to be permutation-invariant. As shown in Theorem 1 and 2, there are two MIL pooling operators that ensure the score function (i.e., the bag probability) to be a symmetric function, namely, the maximum operator: ∀ m=1,...,M : z m = max k=1,...,K {h km }, (5) and the mean operator: 2 z = 1 K K k=1 h k . (6) In fact, other operators could be used such as, the convex maximum operator (i.e., log-sum-exp) (Ramon & De Raedt, 2000) , Integrated Segmentation and Recognition (Keeler et al., 1991) , noisy-or (Maron & Lozano-Pérez, 1998 ) and noisy-and (Kraus et al., 2016) . These MIL pooling operators could replace max in Theorem 2 and proofs would follow in a similar manner (see Supplementary in  for a detailed proof for the maximum operator). All of these operators are differentiable, hence, they could be easily used as a MIL pooling layer in a deep neural network architecture.'),\n",
       "  ('Attention-based MIL pooling',\n",
       "   'All MIL pooling operators mentioned in the previous section have a clear disadvantage, namely, they are pre-defined and non-trainable. For instance, the max-operator could be a good choice in the instance-based approach but it might be inappropriate for the embedding-based approach. Similarly, the mean operator is definitely a bad MIL pooling to aggregate instance scores, although, it could succeed in calculating the bag representation. Therefore, a flexible and adaptive MIL pooling could potentially achieve better results by adjusting to a task and data. Ideally, such MIL pooling should also be interpretable, a trait that is missing in all operators mentioned in Section 2.3.')],\n",
       " '7': ['Attention mechanism We propose to use a weighted average of instances (low-dimensional embeddings) where weights are determined by a neural network. Additionally, the weights must sum to 1 to be invariant to the size of a bag. The weighted average fulfills the requirements of the Theorem 1 where the weights together with the embeddings are part of the f function. Let H = {h 1 , . . . , h K } be a bag of K embeddings, then we propose the following MIL pooling: z = K k=1 a k h k , (7) where: a k = exp{w tanh Vh k } K j=1 exp{w tanh Vh j } , (8) where w ∈ R L×1 and V ∈ R L×M are parameters. Moreover, we utilize the hyperbolic tangent tanh(·) element-wise non-linearity to include both negative and positive values for proper gradient flow. The proposed construction allows to discover (dis)similarities among instances. Interestingly, the proposed MIL pooling corresponds to a version of the attention mechanism (Lin et al., 2017; Raffel & Ellis, 2015) . The main difference is that typically in the attention mechanism all instances are sequentially dependent while here we assume that all instances are independent. Therefore, a naturally arising question is whether the attention mechanism could work without sequential dependencies among instances, and if it will not learn the mean operator. We will address this issue in the experiments. Gated attention mechanism Furthermore, we notice that the tanh(·) non-linearity could be inefficient to learn complex relations. Our concern follows from the fact that tanh(x) is approximately linear for x ∈ [−1, 1], which could limit the final expressiveness of learned relations among instances. Therefore, we propose to additionally use the gating mechanism (Dauphin et al., 2016) together with tanh(·) non-linearity that yields: a k = exp{w tanh Vh k sigm Uh k } K j=1 exp{w tanh Vh j ) sigm Uh j } , (9) where U ∈ R L×M are parameters, is an element-wise multiplication and sigm(·) is the sigmoid non-linearity. The gating mechanism introduces a learnable non-linearity that potentially removes the troublesome linearity in tanh(·). Flexibility In principle, the proposed attention-based MIL pooling allows to assign different weights to instances within a bag and hence the final representation of the bag could be highly informative for the bag-level classifier. In other words, it should be able to find key instances. Moreover, application of the attention-based MIL pooling together with the transformations f and g parameterized by neural networks makes the whole model fully differentiable and adaptive. These two facts make the proposed MIL pooling a potentially very flexible operator that could model an arbitrary permutation-invariant score function. The proposed attention mechanism together with a deep MIL model is depicted in Figure 6 (c) in the Appendix. Interpretability Ideally, in the case of a positive label (Y = 1), high attention weights should be assigned to instances that are likely to have label y k = 1 (key instances). Namely, the attention mechanism allows to easily interpret the provided decision in terms of instance-level labels. In fact, the attention network does not provide scores as the instance-based classifier does but it can be considered as a proxy to that. The attention-based MIL pooling bridges the instance-level approach and the embedding-level approach. From the practical point of view, e.g., in the computational pathology, it is desirable to provide ROIs together with the final diagnosis to a doctor. Therefore, the attention mechanism is potentially of great interest in practical applications.'],\n",

       "   'MIL pooling Typically, MIL approaches utilize either the mean pooling or the max pooling, while the latter is mostly used Pinheiro & Collobert, 2015; Zhu et al., 2017) . Both operators are non-trainable which potentially limits their applicability. There are MIL pooling operators that contain global adaptive parameters, such as noisy-and (Kraus et al., 2016) , however, their flexibility is restricted. We propose a fully trainable MIL pooling that adapts to new instances. MIL with neural networks In the classical work on MIL it is assumed that instances are represented by precomputed features and there is very little need to apply additional feature extraction. Nevertheless, recent work on utilizing fully-connected neural networks in MIL shows that it could still be beneficial (Wang et al., 2016) . Similarly, in computer vision the idea of MIL combined with deep learning significantly improves final accuracy (Oquab et al., 2014) . In this paper, we follow this line of research since it allows to apply a flexible class of transformations that can be trained end-to-end by backpropagation.')],\n",
       " '9': ['MIL and attention The attention mechanism is widely used in deep learning for image captioning (Xu et al., 2015) or text analysis (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2017) . In the context of the MIL problem it has rarely been used and only in a very limited form. In (Pappas & Popescu-Belis, 2014 ) an attention-based MIL was proposed but attention weights were trained as parameters of an auxiliary linear regression model. This idea was further expanded and the linear regression model was replaced by a one-layer neural network with single output (Pappas & Popescu-Belis, 2017) . The attention-based MIL operator was used very recently in , however, the attention was calculated using the dot product and it performed worse than the max operator. Here, we propose to use a two-layered neural network to learn the MIL operator and we show that it outperforms commonly used MIL pooling operators. MIL for medical imaging The MIL seems to perfectly fit medical imaging where processing a whole image consisting of billions of pixels is computationally infeasible. Moreover, in the medical domain it is very difficult to obtain pixel-level annotations, that drastically reduces number of available data. Therefore, it is tempting to divide a medical image into smaller patches that could be further considered as a bag with a single label (Quellec et al., 2017) . This idea attracts a great interest in the computational histopathology where patches could correspond to cells that are believed to indicate malignant changes (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) . Different MIL approaches were used for histopathology data, such as, Gaussian processes (Kandemir et al., 2014; or a two-stage approach with neural networks and EM algorithm to determine instance classes (Hou et al., 2016) . Other applications of MIL methods in medical imaging are mammography (nodule) classification (Zhu et al., 2017) and microscopy cell detection (Kraus et al., 2016) . In this paper, we show that the proposed attention-based deep MIL approach can be used not only to provide the final diagnosis but also to indicate ROIs in a histopathology slide.'],\n",

       "   \"In the experiments we aim at evaluating the proposed approach: a MIL model parameterized with neural networks and a (gated) attention-based pooling layer ('Attention' and 'Gated-Attention'). We evaluate our approach on a number of different MIL datasets: five MIL benchmark datasets (MUSK1, MUSK2, FOX, TIGER, ELEPHANT), an MNIST-based image dataset (MNIST-BAGS) and two reallife histopathology datasets (BREAST CANCER, COLON CANCER). We want to verify two research questions in the experiments: (i) whether our approach achieves the best performance or is comparable to the best performing method, (ii) if our method can provide interpretable results by using the attention weights that indicate key instances or ROIs. In order to obtain a fair comparison we use a common evaluation methodology, i.e., 10-fold-cross-validation, and five repetitions per experiment. In the case of MNIST-BAGS we use a fixed division into training and test set. In order to create test bags we solely sampled images from the MNIST test set. During training we only used images from the MNIST training set. For all experiments we use modified versions of models that have shown high classification performance on the individual datasets (Wang et al., 2016; LeCun et al., 1998; Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) . The MIL pooling layers are either located before the last layer of the model (the embedded-based approach) or after last layer of the model (the instance-based approach). If an attention-based MIL pooling layer is used the number of parameters in V was determined using a validation set. We tested the following dimensions (L): 64, 128 and 256. The different dimensions only resulted in minor changes of the model's performance. For layers using the gated attention mechanism V and U have the same number of parameters. Finally, all layers were initialized according to Glorot & Bengio (2010) and biases were set to zero. We compare our approach to various MIL methods on MIL benchmark datasets. On the image datasets our method is compared with instance-level and embedding-level neural networks and commonly used MIL pooling layers (max and mean). In the following, we are using 'Instance+max/mean' and 'Embedding+max/mean' to indicate networks that are build from convolutional layers and fully-connected layers. In contrast to networks purely build from fully-connected layers, referred to as 'mi-Net' and 'MI-Net' (Wang et al., 2016) . On MNIST-BAGS we include a SVM-based MIL model, called (MI-SVM). We do not present results of MI-SVM on the histopathology datasets since we could not train (including hyperparameter search and five times 10-fold-crossvalidation procedure) the model in a reasonable amount of time. 3 In order to compare the bag level performance we use the following metrics: the classification accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\"),\n",

       "   'Details In the first experiment we aim at verifying whether our approach can compete with the best MIL methods on historically important benchmark datasets. Since all five datasets contain precomputed features and only a small number of instances and bags, neural networks are most likely not well suited. First we predict drug activity (MUSK1 and MUSK2). A molecule has the desired drug effect if and only if one or more of its conformations bind to the target binding site. Since molecules can adopt multiple shapes, a bag is made up of shapes belonging to the same molecule (Dietterich et al., 1997) . The three remaining datasets, ELE-PHANT, FOX and TIGER, contain features extracted from images. Each bag consists of a set of segments of an image. For each category, positive bags are images that contain the animal of interest, and negative bags are images that contain other animals (Andrews et al., 2003) . For detailed information on the number of bags, instances and features in each dataset see Section 6.3 in the Appendix. In our experiments we use the same architecture, optimizer and hyperparameters as in the MI-Net model (Wang et al., 2016) . presented in Table 1 .

       "   \"Details The main disadvantage of the classical MIL benchmark datasets is that instances are represented by precomputed features. In order to consider a more challenging scenario, we propose to investigate a dataset that is created using the well-known MNIST image dataset. A bag is made up of a random number of 28 × 28 grayscale images taken from the MNIST dataset. The number of images in a bag is Gaussian-distributed and the closest integer value is taken. A bag is given a positive label if it contains one or more images with the label '9'. We chose '9' since it can be easily mistaken with '7' or '4'. We investigate the influence of the number of bags in the training set as well as the average number of instances per bag on the prediction performance. During evaluation we use a fixed number of 1000 test bags. For all experiments a LeNet5 model is used (LeCun et al., 1998) , see Table 8 and 9 in the Appendix. The models are trained with the Adam optimization algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014) . We keep the default parameters for β 1 and β 2 , see Table 10 in the Appendix. In addition, we compare our method with a SVM-based MIL method (MI-SVM) (Andrews et al., 2003) that uses a Gaussian kernel on raw pixel features 4 . In the experiments we use different numbers of the mean bag size, namely, 10, 50 and 100, and the variance 2, 10, 20, respectively. Moreover, we use varying numbers of training bags, i.e., 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500.

       "   'Details An automatic detection of cancerous regions in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images is a task with high clinical relevance. Current supervised approaches utilize pixel-level annotations (Litjens et al., 2017) . However, data preparation requires large amount of time from pathologists which highly interferes with their daily routines. Hence, a successful solution working with weak labels would hold a great promise to reduce the workload of the pathologists. In the following, we perform two experiments on classifying weakly-labeled real-life histopathol-ogy images of the breast cancer dataset (BREAST CANCER) (Gelasca et al., 2008) and the colon cancer dataset (COLON CANCER) (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) . BREAST CANCER consists of 58 weakly labeled 896 × 768 H&E images. An image is labeled malignant if it contains breast cancer cells, otherwise it is benign. We divide every image into 32 × 32 patches. This results in 672 patches per bag. A patch is discarded if it contains 75% or more of white pixels. COLON CANCER comprises 100 H&E images. The images originate from a variety of tissue appearance from both normal and malignant regions. For every image the majority of nuclei of each cell were marked. In total there are 22,444 nuclei with associated class label, i.e. epithelial, inflammatory, fibroblast, and miscellaneous. A bag is composed of 27 × 27 patches. Furthermore, a bag is given a positive label if it contains one or more nuclei from the epithelial class. Tagging epithelial cells is highly relevant from a clinical point of view, since colon cancer originates from epithelial cells (Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2007) . For both datasets we use the model proposed in (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) for the transformation f . All models are trained with the Adam optimization algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014) . Due to the limited amount of data samples in both datasets we performed data augmentation to prevent overfitting. See the Appendix for further details. Results and discussion We present results in Table 2 and 3 for BREAST CANCER and COLON CANCER, respectively. First, we notice that the obtained results confirm our findings in MNIST-BAGS experiment that our approach outperforms all other methods. A trend that is especially visible in the small-sample size regime of the MNIST-BAGS. Surprisingly, the embedding-based method with the max pooling failed almost completely on BREAST CANCER but in general this dataset is difficult due to high variability of slides and small number of cases. The proposed method is not only most accurate but it also received the highest recall. High recall is especially important in the medical domain since false negatives could lead to severe consequences including patient fatality. We also notice that the gated-attention mechanism performs better than the plain attention mechanism on BREAST CANCER while these two behave similarly on COLON CANCER. Eventually, we present the usefulness of the attention mechanism in providing ROIs. In Figure 5 we show a histopathology image divided into patches containing (mostly) single cells. We create a heatmap by multiplying patches by its corresponding attention weight. Although only image-level annotations are used during training, there is a substantial matching between the heatmap in Figure 5 (d) and the ground truth in Figure 5(c) . Additionally, we notice that Table 2 . Results on BREAST CANCER. Experiments were run 5 times and an average (± a standard error of the mean) is reported. the instance-based classifier tends to select only a small subset of positive patches (see Figure 10 (e) in Appendix) that confirms low instance accuracy of the instance-based approach discussed in (Kandemir & Hamprecht, 2015) .

       " '13': ['Results and discussion The results of AUC for the mean bag sizes equal to 10, 50 and 100 are presented in Figure 1 , 2 and 3, respectively, and detailed results are given in the Appendix. The findings of the experiment are the following: First, the proposed attention-based deep MIL approach performs much better than other methods in the small sample size regime. Moreover, when there is a small effective size of the training set that corresponds to 50-150 bags for around 10 instances per bag (see Figure 1 ) or 50-100 bags in the case of on average 50 instances in a bag (see Figure  2 ), our method still achieves significantly higher AUC than all other methods. Second, we notice that our approach is more flexible and obtained better results than the SVM-   based approach in all cases except large effective sample sizes (see Figure 3) . Third, the embedding-based models performed better than the instance-based models. However, for a sufficient number of training images (number of training bags and training instances per bag) all models achieve very similar results. Fourth, the mean operator performs significantly worse than the max operator. However, the embedding-based model with the mean operator converged eventually to the best value but always later than the one with max. See Section 6.4 in the Appendix for details. The results of this experiment indicate that for a smallsample size regime our approach is preferable to others. Since attention serves as a gradient update filter during backpropagation (Wang et al., 2017) , instances with higher weights will contribute more to learning the encoder network of instances. This is especially important since medical imaging problems contain only a small number of cases. In general, the more instances are in a bag the easier the MIL task becomes, since the MIL assumption states that every instance in a negative bag is negative. For example, a negative bag of size 100 from the MNIST-bags dataset will include about 11 negative examples per class. Finally, we present an exemplary result of the attention mechanism in Figure 4 . In this example a bag consists of 13 images. For each digit the corresponding attention weight is given by the trained network. The bag is properly predicted as positive and all nines are correctly highlighted. Hence, the attention mechanism works as expected. More examples are given in the Appendix.'],\n",

      " In typical machine learning problems like image classification it is assumed that an image clearly represents a category (a class). However, in many real-life applications multiple instances are observed and only a general statement of the category is given. This scenario is called multiple instance learning (MIL) (Dietterich et al., 1997; Maron & Lozano-Pérez, 1998) or, learning from weakly annotated data (Oquab et al., 2014) . The problem of weakly annotated data is especially apparent in medical imaging (Quellec et al., 2017 ) (e.g., computational pathology, mammography or CT lung screening) where an image is typically described by a single label (benign/malignant) or a Region Of Interest (ROI) is roughly given. MIL deals with a bag of instances for which a single class label is assigned. Hence, the main goal of MIL is to learn a Proceedings of the 35 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Stockholm, Sweden, PMLR 80, 2018 . Copyright 2018 by the author(s). model that predicts a bag label, e.g., a medical diagnosis. An additional challenge is to discover key instances (Liu et al., 2012) , i.e., the instances that trigger the bag label. In the medical domain the latter task is of great interest because of legal issues 1 and its usefulness in clinical practice. In order to solve the primary task of a bag classification different methods are proposed, such as utilizing similarities among bags (Cheplygina et al., 2015b) , embedding instances to a compact low-dimensional representation that is further fed to a bag-level classifier (Andrews et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2006) , and combining responses of an instance-level classifier (Ramon & De Raedt, 2000; Raykar et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2006) . Only the last approach is capable of providing interpretable results. However, it was shown that the instance level accuracy of such methods is low (Kandemir & Hamprecht, 2015) and in general there is a disagreement among MIL methods at the instance level (Cheplygina et al., 2015a) . These issues call into question the usability of current MIL models for interpreting the final decision. In this paper, we propose a new method that aims at incorporating interpretability to the MIL approach and increasing its flexibility. We formulate the MIL model using the Bernoulli distribution for the bag label and train it by optimizing the log-likelihood function. We show that the application of the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions provides a general procedure for modeling the bag label probability (the bag score function) that consists of three steps: (i) a transformation of instances to a low-dimensional embedding, (ii) a permutation-invariant (symmetric) aggregation function, and (iii) a final transformation to the bag probability. We propose to parameterize all transformations using neural networks (i.e., a combination of convolutional and fully-connected layers), which increases the flexibility of the approach and allows to train the model in an endto-end manner by optimizing an unconstrained objective function. Last but not least, we propose to replace widelyused permutation-invariant operators such as the maximum operator max and the mean operator mean by a trainable weighted average where weights are given by a two-layered neural network. The two-layered neural network corre-sponds to the attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Raffel & Ellis, 2015) . Notably, the attention weights allow us to find key instances, which could be further used to highlight possible ROIs. In the experiments we show that our model is on a par with the best classical MIL methods on common benchmark MIL datasets, and that it outperforms other methods on a MNIST-based MIL problem as well as two real-life histopathology image datasets. Moreover, in the image datasets we provide empirical evidence that our model can indicate key instances.\n",

      "Results and discussion The results of AUC for the mean bag sizes equal to 10, 50 and 100 are presented in Figure 1 , 2 and 3, respectively, and detailed results are given in the Appendix. The findings of the experiment are the following: First, the proposed attention-based deep MIL approach performs much better than other methods in the small sample size regime. Moreover, when there is a small effective size of the training set that corresponds to 50-150 bags for around 10 instances per bag (see Figure 1 ) or 50-100 bags in the case of on average 50 instances in a bag (see Figure  2 ), our method still achieves significantly higher AUC than all other methods. Second, we notice that our approach is more flexible and obtained better results than the SVM-   based approach in all cases except large effective sample sizes (see Figure 3) . Third, the embedding-based models performed better than the instance-based models. However, for a sufficient number of training images (number of training bags and training instances per bag) all models achieve very similar results. Fourth, the mean operator performs significantly worse than the max operator. However, the embedding-based model with the mean operator converged eventually to the best value but always later than the one with max. See Section 6.4 in the Appendix for details. The results of this experiment indicate that for a smallsample size regime our approach is preferable to others. Since attention serves as a gradient update filter during backpropagation (Wang et al., 2017) , instances with higher weights will contribute more to learning the encoder network of instances. This is especially important since medical imaging problems contain only a small number of cases. In general, the more instances are in a bag the easier the MIL task becomes, since the MIL assumption states that every instance in a negative bag is negative. For example, a negative bag of size 100 from the MNIST-bags dataset will include about 11 negative examples per class. Finally, we present an exemplary result of the attention mechanism in Figure 4 . In this example a bag consists of 13 images. For each digit the corresponding attention weight is given by the trained network. The bag is properly predicted as positive and all nines are correctly highlighted. Hence, the attention mechanism works as expected. More examples are given in the Appendix.\n",

      "  Problem formulation In the classical (binary) supervised learning problem one aims at finding a model that predicts a value of a target variable, y ∈ {0, 1}, for a given instance, x ∈ R D . In the case of the MIL problem, however, instead of a single instance there is a bag of instances, X = {x 1 , . . . , x K }, that exhibit neither dependency nor ordering among each other. We assume that K could vary for different bags. There is also a single binary label Y associated with the bag. Furthermore, we assume that individual labels exist for the instances within a bag, i.e., y 1 , . . . , y K and y k ∈ {0, 1}, for k = 1, . . . , K, however, there is no access to those labels and they remain unknown during training. We can re-write the assumptions of the MIL problem in the following form: Y = 0, iff k y k = 0, 1, otherwise. (1) These assumptions imply that a MIL model must be permutation-invariant. Further, the two statements could be re-formulated in a compact form using the maximum operator: Y = max k {y k }. (2) Learning a model that tries to optimize an objective based on the maximum over instance labels would be problematic at least for two reasons. First, all gradient-based learning methods would encounter issues with vanishing gradients. Second, this formulation is suitable only when an instancelevel classifier is used. In order to make the learning problem easier, we propose to train a MIL model by optimizing the log-likelihood function where the bag label is distributed according to the Bernoulli distribution with the parameter θ(X) ∈ [0, 1], i.e., the probability of Y = 1 given the bag of instances X. MIL approaches In the MIL setting the bag probability θ(X) must be permutation-invariant since we assume neither ordering nor dependency of instances within a bag. Therefore, the MIL problem can be considered in terms of a specific form of the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions with monomials given by the following theorem (Zaheer et al., 2017) : Theorem 1. A scoring function for a set of instances X, S(X) ∈ R, is a symmetric function (i.e., permutationinvariant to the elements in X), if and only if it can be decomposed in the following form: S(X) = g x∈X f (x) , (3) where f and g are suitable transformations. This theorem provides a general strategy for modeling the bag probability using the decomposition given in (3) . A similar decomposition with max instead of sum is given by the following theorem : Theorem 2. For any ε > 0, a Hausdorff continuous symmetric function S(X) ∈ R can be arbitrarily approximated by a function in the form g max x∈X f (x) , where max is the element-wise vector maximum operator and f and g are continuous functions, that is: |S(X) − g max x∈X f (x) | < ε. (4) The difference between Theorems 1 and 2 is that the former is a universal decomposition while the latter provides an arbitrary approximation. Nonetheless, they both formulate a general three-step approach for classifying a bag of instances: (i) a transformation of instances using the function f , (ii) a combination of transformed instances using a symmetric (permutation-invariant) function σ, (iii) a transformation of combined instances transformed by f using a function g. Finally, the expressiveness of the score function relies on the choice of classes of functions for f and g. In the MIL problem formulation the score function in both theorems is the probability θ(X) and the permutationinvariant function σ is referred to as the MIL pooling. The choice of functions f , g and σ determines a specific approach to modeling the label probability. For a given MIL operator there are two main MIL approaches: (i) The instance-level approach: The transformation f is an instance-level classifier that returns scores for each instance. Then individual scores are aggregated by MIL pooling to obtain θ(X). The function g is the identity function. (ii) The embedding-level approach: The function f maps instances to a low-dimensional embedding. MIL pooling is used to obtain a bag representation that is independent of the number of instances in the bag. The bag representation is further processed by a bag-level classifier to provide θ(X). It is advocated in (Wang et al., 2016) that the latter approach is preferable in terms of the bag level classification performance. Since the individual labels are unknown, there is a threat that the instance-level classifier might be trained insufficiently and it introduces additional error to the final prediction. The embedding-level approach determines a joint representation of a bag and therefore it does not introduce additional bias to the bag-level classifier. On the other hand, the instance-level approach provides a score that can be used to find key instances i.e., the instances that trigger the bag label. Liu et al. (2012) were able to show that a model that is successfully detecting key instances is more likely to achieve better bag label predictions. We will show how to modify the embedding-level approach to be interpretable by using a new MIL pooling. In classical MIL problems it is assumed that instances are represented by features that do not require further processing, i.e., f is the identity. However, for some tasks like image or text analysis additional steps of feature extraction are necessary. Additionally, Theorem 1 and 2 indicate that for a flexible enough class of functions we can model any permutation-invariant score function. Therefore, we consider a class of transformations that are parameterized by neural networks f ψ (·) with parameters ψ that transform the k-th instance into a low-dimensional embedding, h k = f ψ (x k ), where h k ∈ H such that H = [0, 1] for the instance-based approach and H = R M for the embeddingbased approach. Eventually, the parameter θ(X) is determined by a transformation g φ : H K → [0, 1]. In the instance-based approach the transformation g φ is simply the identity, while in the embedding-based approach it could be also parameterized by a neural network with parameters φ. The former approach is depicted in Figure 6 (a) and the latter in Figure  6 (b) in the Appendix. The idea of parameterizing all transformations using neural networks is very appealing because the whole approach can be arbitrarily flexible and it can be trained end-to-end by backpropagation. The only restriction is that the MIL pooling must be differentiable. The formulation of the MIL problem requires the MIL pooling σ to be permutation-invariant. As shown in Theorem 1 and 2, there are two MIL pooling operators that ensure the score function (i.e., the bag probability) to be a symmetric function, namely, the maximum operator: ∀ m=1,...,M : z m = max k=1,...,K {h km }, (5) and the mean operator: 2 z = 1 K K k=1 h k . (6) In fact, other operators could be used such as, the convex maximum operator (i.e., log-sum-exp) (Ramon & De Raedt, 2000) , Integrated Segmentation and Recognition (Keeler et al., 1991) , noisy-or (Maron & Lozano-Pérez, 1998 ) and noisy-and (Kraus et al., 2016) . These MIL pooling operators could replace max in Theorem 2 and proofs would follow in a similar manner (see Supplementary in  for a detailed proof for the maximum operator). All of these operators are differentiable, hence, they could be easily used as a MIL pooling layer in a deep neural network architecture. All MIL pooling operators mentioned in the previous section have a clear disadvantage, namely, they are pre-defined and non-trainable. For instance, the max-operator could be a good choice in the instance-based approach but it might be inappropriate for the embedding-based approach. Similarly, the mean operator is definitely a bad MIL pooling to aggregate instance scores, although, it could succeed in calculating the bag representation. Therefore, a flexible and adaptive MIL pooling could potentially achieve better results by adjusting to a task and data. Ideally, such MIL pooling should also be interpretable, a trait that is missing in all operators mentioned in Section 2.3.\n",

      " MIL pooling Typically, MIL approaches utilize either the mean pooling or the max pooling, while the latter is mostly used Pinheiro & Collobert, 2015; Zhu et al., 2017) . Both operators are non-trainable which potentially limits their applicability. There are MIL pooling operators that contain global adaptive parameters, such as noisy-and (Kraus et al., 2016) , however, their flexibility is restricted. We propose a fully trainable MIL pooling that adapts to new instances. MIL with neural networks In the classical work on MIL it is assumed that instances are represented by precomputed features and there is very little need to apply additional feature extraction. Nevertheless, recent work on utilizing fully-connected neural networks in MIL shows that it could still be beneficial (Wang et al., 2016) . Similarly, in computer vision the idea of MIL combined with deep learning significantly improves final accuracy (Oquab et al., 2014) . In this paper, we follow this line of research since it allows to apply a flexible class of transformations that can be trained end-to-end by backpropagation.\n",

      " In the experiments we aim at evaluating the proposed approach: a MIL model parameterized with neural networks and a (gated) attention-based pooling layer ('Attention' and 'Gated-Attention'). We evaluate our approach on a number of different MIL datasets: five MIL benchmark datasets (MUSK1, MUSK2, FOX, TIGER, ELEPHANT), an MNIST-based image dataset (MNIST-BAGS) and two reallife histopathology datasets (BREAST CANCER, COLON CANCER). We want to verify two research questions in the experiments: (i) whether our approach achieves the best performance or is comparable to the best performing method, (ii) if our method can provide interpretable results by using the attention weights that indicate key instances or ROIs. In order to obtain a fair comparison we use a common evaluation methodology, i.e., 10-fold-cross-validation, and five repetitions per experiment. In the case of MNIST-BAGS we use a fixed division into training and test set. In order to create test bags we solely sampled images from the MNIST test set. During training we only used images from the MNIST training set. For all experiments we use modified versions of models that have shown high classification performance on the individual datasets (Wang et al., 2016; LeCun et al., 1998; Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) . The MIL pooling layers are either located before the last layer of the model (the embedded-based approach) or after last layer of the model (the instance-based approach). If an attention-based MIL pooling layer is used the number of parameters in V was determined using a validation set. We tested the following dimensions (L): 64, 128 and 256. The different dimensions only resulted in minor changes of the model's performance. For layers using the gated attention mechanism V and U have the same number of parameters. Finally, all layers were initialized according to Glorot & Bengio (2010) and biases were set to zero. We compare our approach to various MIL methods on MIL benchmark datasets. On the image datasets our method is compared with instance-level and embedding-level neural networks and commonly used MIL pooling layers (max and mean). In the following, we are using 'Instance+max/mean' and 'Embedding+max/mean' to indicate networks that are build from convolutional layers and fully-connected layers. In contrast to networks purely build from fully-connected layers, referred to as 'mi-Net' and 'MI-Net' (Wang et al., 2016) . On MNIST-BAGS we include a SVM-based MIL model, called (MI-SVM). We do not present results of MI-SVM on the histopathology datasets since we could not train (including hyperparameter search and five times 10-fold-crossvalidation procedure) the model in a reasonable amount of time. 3 In order to compare the bag level performance we use the following metrics: the classification accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Details In the first experiment we aim at verifying whether our approach can compete with the best MIL methods on historically important benchmark datasets. Since all five datasets contain precomputed features and only a small number of instances and bags, neural networks are most likely not well suited. First we predict drug activity (MUSK1 and MUSK2). A molecule has the desired drug effect if and only if one or more of its conformations bind to the target binding site. Since molecules can adopt multiple shapes, a bag is made up of shapes belonging to the same molecule (Dietterich et al., 1997) . The three remaining datasets, ELE-PHANT, FOX and TIGER, contain features extracted from images. Each bag consists of a set of segments of an image. For each category, positive bags are images that contain the animal of interest, and negative bags are images that contain other animals (Andrews et al., 2003) . For detailed information on the number of bags, instances and features in each dataset see Section 6.3 in the Appendix. In our experiments we use the same architecture, optimizer and hyperparameters as in the MI-Net model (Wang et al., 2016) . presented in Table 1 . Our approaches (Attention and Gated-Attention) are comparable with the best performing classical MIL methods (notice the standard error of the mean). Details The main disadvantage of the classical MIL benchmark datasets is that instances are represented by precomputed features. In order to consider a more challenging scenario, we propose to investigate a dataset that is created using the well-known MNIST image dataset. A bag is made up of a random number of 28 × 28 grayscale images taken from the MNIST dataset. The number of images in a bag is Gaussian-distributed and the closest integer value is taken. A bag is given a positive label if it contains one or more images with the label '9'. We chose '9' since it can be easily mistaken with '7' or '4'. We investigate the influence of the number of bags in the training set as well as the average number of instances per bag on the prediction performance. During evaluation we use a fixed number of 1000 test bags. For all experiments a LeNet5 model is used (LeCun et al., 1998) , see Table 8 and 9 in the Appendix. The models are trained with the Adam optimization algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014) . We keep the default parameters for β 1 and β 2 , see Table 10 in the Appendix. In addition, we compare our method with a SVM-based MIL method (MI-SVM) (Andrews et al., 2003) that uses a Gaussian kernel on raw pixel features 4 . In the experiments we use different numbers of the mean bag size, namely, 10, 50 and 100, and the variance 2, 10, 20, respectively. Moreover, we use varying numbers of training bags, i.e., 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500. These different settings allow us to verify how different number of training bags and different number of instances influence MIL models. We compare instance-based and embedding-based approaches parameterized with a neural network (LeNet5) with mean and max MIL pooling. We use AUC as the evaluation metric. Details An automatic detection of cancerous regions in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images is a task with high clinical relevance. Current supervised approaches utilize pixel-level annotations (Litjens et al., 2017) . However, data preparation requires large amount of time from pathologists which highly interferes with their daily routines. Hence, a successful solution working with weak labels would hold a great promise to reduce the workload of the pathologists. In the following, we perform two experiments on classifying weakly-labeled real-life histopathol-ogy images of the breast cancer dataset (BREAST CANCER) (Gelasca et al., 2008) and the colon cancer dataset (COLON CANCER) (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) . BREAST CANCER consists of 58 weakly labeled 896 × 768 H&E images. An image is labeled malignant if it contains breast cancer cells, otherwise it is benign. We divide every image into 32 × 32 patches. This results in 672 patches per bag. A patch is discarded if it contains 75% or more of white pixels. COLON CANCER comprises 100 H&E images. The images originate from a variety of tissue appearance from both normal and malignant regions. For every image the majority of nuclei of each cell were marked. In total there are 22,444 nuclei with associated class label, i.e. epithelial, inflammatory, fibroblast, and miscellaneous. A bag is composed of 27 × 27 patches. Furthermore, a bag is given a positive label if it contains one or more nuclei from the epithelial class. Tagging epithelial cells is highly relevant from a clinical point of view, since colon cancer originates from epithelial cells (Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2007) . For both datasets we use the model proposed in (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) for the transformation f . All models are trained with the Adam optimization algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014) . Due to the limited amount of data samples in both datasets we performed data augmentation to prevent overfitting. See the Appendix for further details. Results and discussion We present results in Table 2 and 3 for BREAST CANCER and COLON CANCER, respectively. First, we notice that the obtained results confirm our findings in MNIST-BAGS experiment that our approach outperforms all other methods. A trend that is especially visible in the small-sample size regime of the MNIST-BAGS. Surprisingly, the embedding-based method with the max pooling failed almost completely on BREAST CANCER but in general this dataset is difficult due to high variability of slides and small number of cases. The proposed method is not only most accurate but it also received the highest recall. High recall is especially important in the medical domain since false negatives could lead to severe consequences including patient fatality. We also notice that the gated-attention mechanism performs better than the plain attention mechanism on BREAST CANCER while these two behave similarly on COLON CANCER. Eventually, we present the usefulness of the attention mechanism in providing ROIs. In Figure 5 we show a histopathology image divided into patches containing (mostly) single cells. We create a heatmap by multiplying patches by its corresponding attention weight. Although only image-level annotations are used during training, there is a substantial matching between the heatmap in Figure 5 (d) and the ground truth in Figure 5(c) . Additionally, we notice that Table 2 . Results on BREAST CANCER. Experiments were run 5 times and an average (± a standard error of the mean) is reported. the instance-based classifier tends to select only a small subset of positive patches (see Figure 10 (e) in Appendix) that confirms low instance accuracy of the instance-based approach discussed in (Kandemir & Hamprecht, 2015) .

      " In this paper, we proposed a flexible and interpretable MIL approach that is fully parameterized by neural networks. We outlined the usefulness of deep learning for modeling a permutation-invariant bag score function in terms of the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions. Moreover, we presented a trainable MIL pooling based on the (gated) attention mechanism. We showed empirically on five MIL datasets, one image corpora and two real-life histopathology datasets that our method is on a par with the best performing methods or performs the best in terms of different evaluation metrics. Additionally, we showed that our approach provides an interpretation of the decision by presenting ROIs, which is extremely important in many practical applications. We strongly believe that the presented line of research is worth pursuing further. Here we focused on a binary MIL problem, however, the multi-class MIL is more interesting and challenging . Moreover, in some applications it is worth to consider repulsion points (Scott et al., 2005) , i.e., instances for which a bag is always negative, or assume dependencies among instances within a bag (Zhou et al., 2009) . We leave investigating these issues for future research. 6. Appendix\n",

      "Attention mechanism We propose to use a weighted average of instances (low-dimensional embeddings) where weights are determined by a neural network. Additionally, the weights must sum to 1 to be invariant to the size of a bag. The weighted average fulfills the requirements of the Theorem 1 where the weights together with the embeddings are part of the f function. Let H = {h 1 , . . . , h K } be a bag of K embeddings, then we propose the following MIL pooling: z = K k=1 a k h k , (7) where: a k = exp{w tanh Vh k } K j=1 exp{w tanh Vh j } , (8) where w ∈ R L×1 and V ∈ R L×M are parameters. Moreover, we utilize the hyperbolic tangent tanh(·) element-wise non-linearity to include both negative and positive values for proper gradient flow. The proposed construction allows to discover (dis)similarities among instances. Interestingly, the proposed MIL pooling corresponds to a version of the attention mechanism (Lin et al., 2017; Raffel & Ellis, 2015) . The main difference is that typically in the attention mechanism all instances are sequentially dependent while here we assume that all instances are independent. Therefore, a naturally arising question is whether the attention mechanism could work without sequential dependencies among instances, and if it will not learn the mean operator. We will address this issue in the experiments. Gated attention mechanism Furthermore, we notice that the tanh(·) non-linearity could be inefficient to learn complex relations. Our concern follows from the fact that tanh(x) is approximately linear for x ∈ [−1, 1], which could limit the final expressiveness of learned relations among instances. Therefore, we propose to additionally use the gating mechanism (Dauphin et al., 2016) together with tanh(·) non-linearity that yields: a k = exp{w tanh Vh k sigm Uh k } K j=1 exp{w tanh Vh j ) sigm Uh j } , (9) where U ∈ R L×M are parameters, is an element-wise multiplication and sigm(·) is the sigmoid non-linearity. The gating mechanism introduces a learnable non-linearity that potentially removes the troublesome linearity in tanh(·). Flexibility In principle, the proposed attention-based MIL pooling allows to assign different weights to instances within a bag and hence the final representation of the bag could be highly informative for the bag-level classifier. In other words, it should be able to find key instances. Moreover, application of the attention-based MIL pooling together with the transformations f and g parameterized by neural networks makes the whole model fully differentiable and adaptive. These two facts make the proposed MIL pooling a potentially very flexible operator that could model an arbitrary permutation-invariant score function. The proposed attention mechanism together with a deep MIL model is depicted in Figure 6 (c) in the Appendix. Interpretability Ideally, in the case of a positive label (Y = 1), high attention weights should be assigned to instances that are likely to have label y k = 1 (key instances). Namely, the attention mechanism allows to easily interpret the provided decision in terms of instance-level labels. In fact, the attention network does not provide scores as the instance-based classifier does but it can be considered as a proxy to that. The attention-based MIL pooling bridges the instance-level approach and the embedding-level approach. From the practical point of view, e.g., in the computational pathology, it is desirable to provide ROIs together with the final diagnosis to a doctor. Therefore, the attention mechanism is potentially of great interest in practical applications.\n",

      "MIL and attention The attention mechanism is widely used in deep learning for image captioning (Xu et al., 2015) or text analysis (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2017) . In the context of the MIL problem it has rarely been used and only in a very limited form. In (Pappas & Popescu-Belis, 2014 ) an attention-based MIL was proposed but attention weights were trained as parameters of an auxiliary linear regression model. This idea was further expanded and the linear regression model was replaced by a one-layer neural network with single output (Pappas & Popescu-Belis, 2017) . The attention-based MIL operator was used very recently in , however, the attention was calculated using the dot product and it performed worse than the max operator. Here, we propose to use a two-layered neural network to learn the MIL operator and we show that it outperforms commonly used MIL pooling operators. MIL for medical imaging The MIL seems to perfectly fit medical imaging where processing a whole image consisting of billions of pixels is computationally infeasible. Moreover, in the medical domain it is very difficult to obtain pixel-level annotations, that drastically reduces number of available data. Therefore, it is tempting to divide a medical image into smaller patches that could be further considered as a bag with a single label (Quellec et al., 2017) . This idea attracts a great interest in the computational histopathology where patches could correspond to cells that are believed to indicate malignant changes (Sirinukunwattana et al., 2016) . Different MIL approaches were used for histopathology data, such as, Gaussian processes (Kandemir et al., 2014; or a two-stage approach with neural networks and EM algorithm to determine instance classes (Hou et al., 2016) . Other applications of MIL methods in medical imaging are mammography (nodule) classification (Zhu et al., 2017) and microscopy cell detection (Kraus et al., 2016) . In this paper, we show that the proposed attention-based deep MIL approach can be used not only to provide the final diagnosis but also to indicate ROIs in a histopathology slide.\n"

       "{'1': ['Introduction Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [12] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [29, 2, 5] . Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [31, 21, 13] . Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h t , as a function of the previous hidden state h t−1 and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional computation [26] , while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains. Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 16] . In all but a few cases [22] , however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network. In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.'],\n",
       " '2': ['Background The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [20] , ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8] , all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11] . In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19] . End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28] . To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8] .'],\n",
       " '3': ['Model Architecture Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29] . Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x 1 , ..., x n ) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z 1 , ..., z n ). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y 1 , ..., y m ) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [9] , consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1 , respectively.',\n",
       "  'Encoder and Decoder Stacks Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position- wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1] . That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d model = 512. Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.',\n",
       "  'Attention An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. query with all keys, divide each by √ d k , and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.',\n",
       "  'Scaled Dot-Product Attention In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as: Attention(Q, K, V ) = softmax( QK T √ d k )V (1) The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2] , and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1 √ d k . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. While for small values of d k the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d k [3] . We suspect that for large values of d k , the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4 . To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1 √ d k .',\n",
       "  'Multi-Head Attention Instead of performing a single attention function with d model -dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d k , d k and d v dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d v -dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2 . Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this. MultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head 1 , ..., head h )W O where head i = Attention(QW Q i , KW K i , V W V i ) Where the projections are parameter matrices W Q i ∈ R dmodel×d k , W K i ∈ R dmodel×d k , W V i ∈ R dmodel×dv and W O ∈ R hdv×dmodel . In this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use d k = d v = d model /h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.',\n",
       "  'Applications of Attention in our Model The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways: • In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [31, 2, 8 ].',\n",
       "  'Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. FFN(x) = max(0, xW 1 + b 1 )W 2 + b 2 (2) While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is d model = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality d f f = 2048.',\n",
       "  'Embeddings and Softmax Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension d model . We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [24] . In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √ d model .',\n",
       "  'Positional Encoding Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the Table 1 : Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel size of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention. Layer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length Operations Self-Attention O(n 2 · d) O(1) O(1) Recurrent O(n · d 2 ) O(n) O(n) Convolutional O(k · n · d 2 ) O(1) O(log k (n)) Self-Attention (restricted) O(r · n · d) O(1) O(n/r) bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d model as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [8] . In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies: where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P E pos+k can be represented as a linear function of P E pos . We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [8] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.'],\n",
       " '4': ['Why Self-Attention In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations (x 1 , ..., x n ) to another sequence of equal length (z 1 , ..., z n ), with x i , z i ∈ R d , such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata. One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required. The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11] . Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types. As noted in Table 1 , a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work. A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O(log k (n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [15] , increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6] , however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d 2 ). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model. As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.'],\n",

       "  'Machine Translation On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2 ) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3 . Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0, outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P drop = 0.1, instead of 0.3. For the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [31] . These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [31] .',\n",
       "  'Model Variations To evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the development set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3 . In Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads. In Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size d k hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [8] , and observe nearly identical results to the base model.'],\n",
       " '7': ['Conclusion In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention. For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles. We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours. The code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor.'],\n",
